  Abstract                 = {A real-time electronic predictive model that identifies hospitalized heart failure (HF) patients at high risk for readmission or death may be valuable to clinicians and hospitals who care for these patients.An automated predictive model for 30-day readmission and death was derived and validated from clinical and nonclinical risk factors present on admission in 1372 HF hospitalizations to a major urban hospital between January 2007 and August 2008. Data were extracted from an electronic medical record. The performance of the electronic model was compared with mortality and readmission models developed by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS models) and a HF mortality model derived from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Registry (ADHERE model).The 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 3.1\% and 24.1\% respectively. The electronic model demonstrated good discrimination for 30 day mortality (C statistic 0.86) and readmission (C statistic 0.72) and performed as well, or better than, the ADHERE model and CMS models for both outcomes (C statistic ranges: 0.72-0.73 and 0.56-0.66 for mortality and readmissions respectively; P < 0.05 in all comparisons). Markers of social instability and lower socioeconomic status improved readmission prediction in the electronic model (C statistic 0.72 vs. 0.61, P < 0.05).Clinical and social factors available within hours of hospital presentation and extractable from an EMR predicted mortality and readmission at 30 days. Incorporating complex social factors increased the model's accuracy, suggesting that such factors could enhance risk adjustment models designed to compare hospital readmission rates.},

It then looks at each subsequent five-year epoch, with a focus on papers appearing in Statistics in Medicine, putting these in the context of major developments in Bayesian thinking and computation with reference to important books, landmark meetings and seminal papers. It charts the growth of Bayesian statistics as it is applied to medicine and makes predictions for the future. From sparse beginnings, where Bayesian statistics was barely mentioned, Bayesian statistics has now permeated all the major areas of medical statistics, including clinical trials, epidemiology, meta-analyses and evidence synthesis, spatial modelling, longitudinal modelling, survival modelling, molecular genetics and decision-making in respect of new technologies.},

Particularly, when one or more predictors correlate with the group or unit effects, a key Gauss-Markov assumption is violated and estimates are compromised. However, this problem can easily be solved by including the average of each individual-level predictors in the group-level regression. We explain the solution, demonstrate its effectiveness using simulations, show how it can be applied in some commonly-used statistical software, and discuss its potential for substantive modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops and implements a fully Bayesian approach to meta-analysis, in which uncertainty about effects in distinct but comparable studies is represented by an exchangeable prior distribution. Specifically, hierarchical normal models are used, along with a parametrization that allows a unified approach to deal easily with both clinical trial and case-control study data. Monte Carlo methods are used to obtain posterior distributions for parameters of interest, integrating out the unknown parameters of the exchangeable prior or 'random effects' distribution. The approach is illustrated with two examples, the first involving a data set on the effect of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction, and the second based on a classic data set comprising 14 case-control studies on the effects of smoking on lung cancer. In both examples, rather different conclusions from those previously published are obtained. In particular, it is claimed that widely used methods for meta-analysis, which involve complete pooling of 'O-E' values, lead to understatement of uncertainty in the estimation of overall or typical effect size.},

In either approach, it is possible to include auxiliary variables solely for the purpose of improving the missing data procedure. A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to make a missing at random (MAR) or ignorability assumption realistic, auxiliary covariates are often required. However, the auxiliary covariates are not desired in the model for inference. Typical multiple imputation approaches do not assume that the imputation model marginalizes to the inference model. This has been termed "uncongenial" [Meng (1994, Statistical Science 9, 538-558)]. In order to make the two models congenial (or compatible), we would rather not assume a parametric model for the marginal distribution of the auxiliary covariates, but we typically do not have enough data to estimate the joint distribution well non-parametrically. In addition, when the imputation model uses a non-linear link function (e.g., the logistic link for a binary response), the marginalization over the auxiliary covariates to derive the inference model typically results in a difficult to interpret form for the effect of covariates. In this article, we propose a fully Bayesian approach to ensure that the models are compatible for incomplete longitudinal data by embedding an interpretable inference model within an imputation model and that also addresses the two complications described above. We evaluate the approach via simulations and implement it on a recent clinical trial.},

We manually searched journals and the bibliographies of other review articles and called on the opinions of recognized experts.We reviewed studies that met the following criteria: randomized controlled trials of education strategies or interventions that objectively assessed physician performance and/or health care outcomes. These intervention strategies included (alone and in combination) educational materials, formal CME activities, outreach visits such as academic detailing, opinion leaders, patient-mediated strategies, audit with feedback, and reminders. Studies were selected only if more than 50\% of the subjects were either practicing physicians or medical residents.We extracted the specialty of the physicians targeted by the interventions and the clinical domain and setting of the trial. We also determined the details of the educational intervention, the extent to which needs or barriers to change had been ascertained prior to the intervention, and the main outcome measure(s).We found 99 trials, containing 160 interventions, that met our criteria. Almost two thirds of the interventions (101 of 160) displayed an improvement in at least one major outcome measure: 70\% demonstrated a change in physician performance, and 48\% of interventions aimed at health care outcomes produced a positive change. Effective change strategies included reminders, patient-mediated interventions, outreach visits, opinion leaders, and multifaceted activities. Audit with feedback and educational materials were less effective, and formal CME conferences or activities, without enabling or practice-reinforcing strategies, had relatively little impact.Widely used CME delivery methods such as conferences have little direct impact on improving professional practice. More effective methods such as systematic practice-based interventions and outreach visits are seldom used by CME providers.},

Although chronic conditions were most common, EMRs were also used to study less common diseases, highlighting the EMRs' flexibility to examine large cohorts as well as identify patients with rare diseases. Traditional multi-variate modeling techniques were the most commonly used technique to address confounding and potential selection bias. Data validation was a component in a quarter of studies, and many evaluated the EMR's ability to achieve similar results previously achieved using other data sources. Investigators using EMR data should aim for consistent terminology, focus on adequately describing their methods, and consider appropriate statistical methods to control for confounding and treatment-selection bias.},

We used this data to compare screening immediately before IPF and following each IPF report.Screening increased steadily over time, from 60\% of appropriate visits before IPF to 91\% after the fourth report (Chi Square 28.4, p<.001). Adjusting for key factors, the odds of screening after the last IPF report were seven and a half times greater than the odds of screening before IPF (Odds Ratio: 7.6; 95\% Confidence Interval: 3.0, 19.0).IPF was associated with increased DV screening among first and second year ob/gyn residents in this setting. Increased screening improved compliance with the clinic protocol and increased opportunities for patient disclosure, education, and treatment, critical public health objectives.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers five methods of analysis of longitudinal assessment of health related quality of life (QOL) in two clinical trials of cancer therapy. The primary difference in the two trials is the proportion of participants who experience disease progression or death during the period of QOL assessments. The sensitivity of estimation of parameters and hypothesis tests to the potential bias as a consequence of the assumptions of missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) and non-ignorable mechanisms are examined. The methods include complete case analysis (MCAR), mixed-effects models (MAR), a joint mixed-effects and survival model and a pattern-mixture model. Complete case analysis overestimated QOL in both trials. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial, with 15 per cent disease progression, estimates were consistent across the remaining four methods. In the advanced non-small-cell lung cancer trial, with 35 per cent mortality, estimates were sensitive to the missing data assumptions and methods of analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {As more patients survive the acute respiratory distress syndrome, an understanding of the long-term outcomes of this condition is needed.We evaluated 109 survivors of the acute respiratory distress syndrome 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge from the intensive care unit. At each visit, patients were interviewed and underwent a physical examination, pulmonary-function testing, a six-minute-walk test, and a quality-of-life evaluation.Patients who survived the acute respiratory distress syndrome were young (median age, 45 years) and severely ill (median Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation score, 23) and had a long stay in the intensive care unit (median, 25 days). Patients had lost 18 percent of their base-line body weight by the time they were discharged from the intensive care unit and stated that muscle weakness and fatigue were the reasons for their functional limitation. Lung volume and spirometric measurements were normal by 6 months, but carbon monoxide diffusion capacity remained low throughout the 12-month follow-up. No patients required supplemental oxygen at 12 months, but 6 percent of patients had arterial oxygen saturation values below 88 percent during exercise. The median score for the physical role domain of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (a health-related quality-of-life measure) increased from 0 at 3 months to 25 at 12 months (score in the normal population, 84). The distance walked in six minutes increased from a median of 281 m at 3 months to 422 m at 12 months; all values were lower than predicted. The absence of systemic corticosteroid treatment, the absence of illness acquired during the intensive care unit stay, and rapid resolution of lung injury and multiorgan dysfunction were associated with better functional status during the one-year follow-up.Survivors of the acute respiratory distress syndrome have persistent functional disability one year after discharge from the intensive care unit. Most patients have extrapulmonary conditions, with muscle wasting and weakness being most prominent.},

A greater percentage of patients from the general wards (47.6\%) died than from OR (19.3\%) and ED (31.5\%). Patients from the general wards had a greater number of serious antecedents before admission to intensive care 43 (72\%) than those from OR 150 (64.4\%) or ED 126 (61.8\%). Of the 551 patients 62 had antecedents during the period 8-48 h before admission to intensive care, and 53 had antecedents both within 8 and 48 h before their admission. The most common antecedents during the 8 h before admission were hypotension (n=199), tachycardia (n=73), tachypnoea (n=64), and sudden change in level of consciousness (n=42). Concern was expressed in the clinical notes by attending staff in 70\% of patients admitted from the general wards.In over 60\% of patients admitted to intensive care potentially life-threatening abnormalities were documented during the 8 h before their admission. This may represent a patient population who could benefit from improved resuscitation and care at an earlier stage.},

Assessors disagreed on quality of management of 26 patients (group 3). The casemix and severity of illness, defined by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score, were similar between centres and the three groups. In groups 1, 2, and 3 intensive care mortalities were 5 (25\%), 26 (48\%), and 6 (23\%) respectively (P=0.04) (group 1 versus group 2, P=0.07). Hospital mortalities were 7 (35\%), 30 (56\%), and 8 (31\%) (P=0.07) and standardised hospital mortality ratios (95\% confidence intervals) were 1.23 (0.49 to 2.54), 1.4 (0.94 to 2.0), and 1.26 (0.54 to 2.48) respectively. Admission to intensive care was considered late in 37 (69\%) patients in group 2. Overall, a minimum of 4.5\% and a maximum of 41\% of admissions were considered potentially avoidable. Suboptimal care contributed to morbidity or mortality in most instances. The main causes of suboptimal care were failure of organisation, lack of knowledge, failure to appreciate clinical urgency, lack of supervision, and failure to seek advice.The management of airway, breathing, and circulation, and oxygen therapy and monitoring in severely ill patients before admission to intensive care units may frequently be suboptimal. Major consequences may include increased morbidity and mortality and requirement for intensive care. Possible solutions include improved teaching, establishment of medical emergency teams, and widespread debate on the structure and process of acute care.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine whether the introduction of a multi-faceted intervention (newly designed ward observation chart, a track and trigger system and an associated education program, COMPASS) to detect clinical deterioration in patients would decrease the rate of predefined adverse outcomes.A prospective, controlled before-and-after intervention of trial was conducted in all consecutive adult patients admitted to four medical and surgical wards during a 4 month period, 1157 and 985, respectively. A sub-group of patients underwent vital sign and medical review analysis pre-intervention (427) and post-intervention (320). The outcome measures included: number of unplanned admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), Medical Emergency Team (MET) reviews and unexpected hospital deaths, vital sign documentation frequency and incidence of a medical review following clinical deterioration. This study is registered, ACTRN12609000808246.Reductions were seen in unplanned admissions to ICU (21/1157 [1.8\%] vs. 5/985 [0.5\%], p=0.006) and unexpected hospital deaths (11/1157 [1.0\%] vs. 2/985 [0.2\%], p=0.03) during the intervention period. Medical reviews for patients with significant clinical instability (58/133 [43.6\%] vs. 55/79 [69.6\%] p<0.001) and number of patients receiving a MET review increased (25/1157 [2.2\%] vs. 38/985 [3.9\%] p=0.03) during the intervention period. Mean daily frequency of documentation of all vital signs increased during the intervention period (3.4 [SE 0.22] vs. 4.5 [SE 0.17], p=0.001).The introduction of a multi-faceted intervention to detect clinical deterioration may benefit patients through increased monitoring of vital signs and the triggering of a medical review following an episode of clinical instability.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite more than four decades of experience with in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest, outcomes have remained poor. Numerous studies have documented the physiological instability leading to clinical deterioration, which often precedes cardiopulmonary arrest. These physiological changes often go unrecognized or are acted upon inadequately. This has led to the development of interventions aimed at anticipating and/or preventing cardiopulmonary arrest. In this review, we summarize the current literature regarding outcomes from in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest, the physiological instability leading to clinical deterioration which often precedes cardiopulmonary arrest, and the various interventions to anticipate and prevent in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. These interventions include the use of intermediate care units, Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS) and Medical Emergency Teams (MET). These interventions may have the potential to decrease the cardiac arrest rate and in-hospital mortality rate associated with cardiac arrest; however, controversy remains regarding some of these interventions. The use of intermediate care units may require an organized approach to identify patients who are acutely ill and would benefit from this specialized care. There is not enough evidence currently to support the benefit of Modified Early Warning Scores to prevent in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. Recent studies of the Medical Emergency Team have shown a significant decrease in cardiac arrest and overall mortality rates with this intervention. The Medical Emergency Team is an intervention, which requires further studies to define its role in other aspects of hospital patient care.},

  Abstract                 = {Goal-directed therapy has been used for severe sepsis and septic shock in the intensive care unit. This approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit.We randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. Clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. In-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups.Of the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were randomly assigned to early goal-directed therapy and 133 to standard therapy; there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to base-line characteristics. In-hospital mortality was 30.5 percent in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5 percent in the group assigned to standard therapy (P = 0.009). During the interval from 7 to 72 hours, the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy had a significantly higher mean (+/-SD) central venous oxygen saturation (70.4+/-10.7 percent vs. 65.3+/-11.4 percent), a lower lactate concentration (3.0+/-4.4 vs. 3.9+/-4.4 mmol per liter), a lower base deficit (2.0+/-6.6 vs. 5.1+/-6.7 mmol per liter), and a higher pH (7.40+/-0.12 vs. 7.36+/-0.12) than the patients assigned to standard therapy (P < or = 0.02 for all comparisons). During the same period, mean APACHE II scores were significantly lower, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy than in those assigned to standard therapy (13.0+/-6.3 vs. 15.9+/-6.4, P < 0.001).Early goal-directed therapy provides significant benefits with respect to outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.},

Three hospitalists reviewed a sample of medical records evaluating the characteristics of severe sepsis.Of 23,288 hospitalizations, 14\% screened positive for severe sepsis. A sample of 111 cases was manually reviewed, identifying 64 cases of severe sepsis. The mean age of patients with severe sepsis was 63 years, and 39\% were immunosuppressed prior to presentation. The most common site of infection was the urinary tract (41\%). The most common organ system dysfunctions were cardiovascular (hypotension) and renal dysfunction occurring in 66\% and 64\% of patients, respectively. An increase in the number of organ systems affected was associated with an increase in mortality and eventual ICU utilization. Severe sepsis was documented by the treating clinicians in 47\% of cases.Severe sepsis was commonly found and poorly documented on the wards at our medical center. The epidemiology and organ dysfunctions among patients with severe sepsis appear to be different from previously described ICU severe sepsis populations.},

In a prospective study, we followed up for 1 year 30 of the original 34 patients who had undergone cardiac surgery with CPB. Patients were assessed preoperatively, before discharge, and at 1 year after surgery with the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and a series of neuropsychological tests. Psychometric scales were administered to evaluate cognitive functioning (Syndrom Kurztest), depressive symptomatology (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), posttraumatic stress symptoms (Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome 10-Questions Inventory) and HRQOL (SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire). Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) was used daily over the course of intensive care unit treatment. Postoperative delirium developed in 11 of the 34 patients (mean DRS rating scale score+/-S.D.: 20.36+/-6.22, range: 14-31). Short-term consequences of cardiac surgery included adjustment disorder with depressed features (n=11), posttraumatic stress disorder (n=6), major depression (n=6) and clinically relevant cognitive deficits (n=13). At 12 months, the severity of depression and anxiety disorders improved and returned to the preoperative level, and 6 out of the 30 followed-up patients displayed cognitive deficits. Our patients' HRQOL SF-36 self-reports significantly improved compared with baseline quality of life data. However, 1-year overall lower cognitive function scores were associated with lower HRQOL. Cardiac surgery with CPB is associated with improvements in HRQOL relative to the preoperative period, but the presence of cardiac surgery-related cognitive decline impairing HRQOL is a complication for a subgroup of cardiac surgical patients in the long-term outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, clear evidence has accumulated that insulin affects central nervous functions. Besides controlling metabolic processes such as energy homeostasis by the regulation of food intake through hypothalamic receptors, the peptide hormone also appears to be capable of modulating cognitive functions. Experimental and clinical evidence for insulin supports effects on learning and memory. This study explores the impact of insulin on neuronal activity using a picture encoding task in a functional magnetic resonance imaging approach. Ten subjects performed two independent scanning sessions, each session divided into one part of four baseline runs and a second part of four runs during either insulin or saline was infused. A hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp technique was applied to keep the blood glucose concentrations normal during insulin infusion. Contrast images between the two parts revealed identical activation patterns during baseline and saline conditions while during the insulin condition a higher level of activation was detected within the fusiform gyrus in both hemispheres. Shorter reaction times during the insulin condition underlined the cognitive benefit. For the first time, we were able to demonstrate that insulin enhances neuronal activity within the medio-temporal lobe and increased performance in humans under in-vivo conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Loss to follow-up (LTFU) is a common problem in many epidemiological studies. In antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), mortality estimates can be biased if the LTFU mechanism is non-ignorable, that is, mortality differs between lost and retained patients. In this setting, routine procedures for handling missing data may lead to biased estimates. To appropriately deal with non-ignorable LTFU, explicit modeling of the missing data mechanism is needed. This can be based on additional outcome ascertainment for a sample of patients LTFU, for example, through linkage to national registries or through survey-based methods. In this paper, we demonstrate how this additional information can be used to construct estimators based on inverse probability weights (IPW) or multiple imputation. We use simulations to contrast the performance of the proposed estimators with methods widely used in HIV cohort research for dealing with missing data. The practical implications of our approach are illustrated using South African ART data, which are partially linkable to South African national vital registration data. Our results demonstrate that while IPWs and proper imputation procedures can be easily constructed from additional outcome ascertainment to obtain valid overall estimates, neglecting non-ignorable LTFU can result in substantial bias. We believe the proposed estimators are readily applicable to a growing number of studies where LTFU is appreciable, but additional outcome data are available through linkage or surveys of patients LTFU.},

On the other hand, investigators and regulatory agencies still struggle with exactly how to assess the results of QOL end points and other patient-reported outcomes. Statisticians are often left in the position of having to bridge the gap between investigators who want to assess patient QOL and regulatory bodies who want a sound scientific rationale and analysis plan for doing so. Unfortunately, little has been written specifically for the statistical audience to assist in this translation. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to bridge this gap. We will describe the language and methods that have been successful in translating the psychometric and statistical challenges into understandable findings for investigators and regulatory agencies. One of the most important advances is the development of a general guideline for assessing clinical significance, namely the "half standard deviation" method based on the empirical rule effect size (ERES) approach. We populate the paper with concrete examples of how QOL data need not be treated any different, in terms of statistical analysis, than tumor response or other clinical end points.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian methods may be defined as the explicit quantitative use of external evidence in the design, monitoring, analysis, interpretation and reporting of a health technology assessment. In outline, the methods involve formal combination through the use of Bayes's theorem of: 1. a prior distribution or belief about the value of a quantity of interest (for example, a treatment effect) based on evidence not derived from the study under analysis, with 2. a summary of the information concerning the same quantity available from the data collected in the study (known as the likelihood), to yield 3. an updated or posterior distribution of the quantity of interest. These methods thus directly address the question of how new evidence should change what we currently believe. They extend naturally into making predictions, synthesising evidence from multiple sources, and designing studies: in addition, if we are willing to quantify the value of different consequences as a 'loss function', Bayesian methods extend into a full decision-theoretic approach to study design, monitoring and eventual policy decision-making. Nonetheless, Bayesian methods are a controversial topic in that they may involve the explicit use of subjective judgements in what is conventionally supposed to be a rigorous scientific exercise.This report is intended to provide: 1. a brief review of the essential ideas of Bayesian analysis 2. a full structured review of applications of Bayesian methods to randomised controlled trials, observational studies, and the synthesis of evidence, in a form which should be reasonably straightforward to update 3. a critical commentary on similarities and differences between Bayesian and conventional approaches 4. criteria for assessing the reporting of a Bayesian analysis 5. a comprehensive list of published 'three-star' examples, in which a proper prior distribution has been used for the quantity of primary interest 6. tutorial case studies of a variety of types 7. recommendations on how Bayesian methods and approaches may be assimilated into health technology assessments in a variety of contexts and by a variety of participants in the research process.The BIDS ISI database was searched using the terms 'Bayes' or 'Bayesian'. This yielded almost 4000 papers published in the period 1990-98. All resultant abstracts were reviewed for relevance to health technology assessment; about 250 were so identified, and used as the basis for forward and backward searches. In addition EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched, along with websites of prominent authors, and available personal collections of references, finally yielding nearly 500 relevant references. A comprehensive review of all references describing use of 'proper' Bayesian methods in health technology assessment (those which update an informative prior distribution through the use of Bayes's theorem) has been attempted, and around 30 such papers are reported in structured form. There has been very limited use of proper Bayesian methods in practice, and relevant studies appear to be relatively easily identified.Bayesian methods in the health technology assessment context 1. Different contexts may demand different statistical approaches. Prior opinions are most valuable when the assessment forms part of a series of similar studies. A decision-theoretic approach may be appropriate where the consequences of a study are reasonably predictable. 2. The prior distribution is important and not unique, and so a range of options should be examined in a sensitivity analysis. Bayesian methods are best seen as a transformation from initial to final opinion, rather than providing a single 'correct' inference. 3. The use of a prior is based on judgement, and hence a degree of subjectivity cannot be avoided. However, subjective priors tend to show predictable biases, and archetypal priors may be useful for identifying a reasonable range of prior opinion.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the greatest challenges in healthcare is how to best translate research evidence into clinical practice, which includes how to change health-care professionals' behaviours. A commonly held view is that multifaceted interventions are more effective than single-component interventions. The purpose of this study was to conduct an overview of systematic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions in comparison to single-component interventions in changing health-care professionals' behaviour in clinical settings.The Rx for Change database, which consists of quality-appraised systematic reviews of interventions to change health-care professional behaviour, was used to identify systematic reviews for the overview. Dual, independent screening and data extraction was conducted. Included reviews used three different approaches (of varying methodological robustness) to evaluate the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions: (1) effect size/dose-response statistical analyses, (2) direct (non-statistical) comparisons of multifaceted to single interventions and (3) indirect comparisons of multifaceted to single interventions.Twenty-five reviews were included in the overview. Three reviews provided effect size/dose-response statistical analyses of the effectiveness of multifaceted interventions; no statistical evidence of a relationship between the number of intervention components and the effect size was found. Eight reviews reported direct (non-statistical) comparisons of multifaceted to single-component interventions; four of these reviews found multifaceted interventions to be generally effective compared to single interventions, while the remaining four reviews found that multifaceted interventions had either mixed effects or were generally ineffective compared to single interventions. Twenty-three reviews indirectly compared the effectiveness of multifaceted to single interventions; nine of which also reported either a statistical (dose-response) analysis (N = 2) or a non-statistical direct comparison (N = 7). The majority (N = 15) of reviews reporting indirect comparisons of multifaceted to single interventions showed similar effectiveness for multifaceted and single interventions when compared to controls. Of the remaining eight reviews, six found single interventions to be generally effective while multifaceted had mixed effectiveness.This overview of systematic reviews offers no compelling evidence that multifaceted interventions are more effective than single-component interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {MicroRNAs (miR) regulate phenotype and function of neurons by binding to miR-response elements (MRE) in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) of various messenger RNAs to inhibit translation. MiR expression can be induced or inhibited by environmental factors like drug exposure and viral infection, leading to changes in cellular physiology. We hypothesized that the effects of methamphetamine (MA) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection in the brain will induce changes in miR expression, and have downstream regulatory consequences in neurons. We first used a PCR-based array to screen for differential expression of 380 miRs in frontal cortex autopsy tissues of HIV-positive MA abusers and matched controls. These results showed significantly increased expression of the neuron-specific miR-9. In vitro, we used SH-SY5Y cells, an experimental system for dopaminergic studies, to determine miR expression by quantitative PCR after exposure to MA in the presence or absence of conditioned media from HIV-infected macrophages. Again, we found that miR-9 was significantly increased compared to controls. We also examined the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, KCNMA1, which has alternative splice variants that contain an MRE to miR-9. We identified alternate 3'UTRs of KCNMA1 both in vitro and in the autopsy specimens and found differential splice variant expression of KCNMA1, operating via the increased miR-9. Our results suggest that HIV and MA -induced elevated miR-9, leading to suppression of MRE-containing splice variants of KCNMA1, which may affect neurotransmitter release in dopaminergic neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing data are common in longitudinal studies due to drop-out, loss to follow-up, and death. Likelihood-based mixed effects models for longitudinal data give valid estimates when the data are missing at random (MAR). These assumptions, however, are not testable without further information. In some studies, there is additional information available in the form of an auxiliary variable known to be correlated with the missing outcome of interest. Availability of such auxiliary information provides us with an opportunity to test the MAR assumption. If the MAR assumption is violated, such information can be utilized to reduce or eliminate bias when the missing data process depends on the unobserved outcome through the auxiliary information. We compare two methods of utilizing the auxiliary information: joint modeling of the outcome of interest and the auxiliary variable, and multiple imputation (MI). Simulation studies are performed to examine the two methods. The likelihood-based joint modeling approach is consistent and most efficient when correctly specified. However, mis-specification of the joint distribution can lead to biased results. MI is slightly less efficient than a correct joint modeling approach and can also be biased when the imputation model is mis-specified, though it is more robust to mis-specification of the imputation distribution when all the variables affecting the missing data mechanism and the missing outcome are included in the imputation model. An example is presented from a dementia screening study.},

  Abstract                 = {Checklists may reduce errors of omission for critically ill patients.To determine whether prompting to use a checklist improves process of care and clinical outcomes.We conducted a cohort study in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of a tertiary care university hospital. Patients admitted to either of two independent MICU teams were included. Intervention team physicians were prompted to address six parameters from a daily rounding checklist if overlooked during morning work rounds. The second team (control) used the identical checklist without prompting.One hundred and forty prompted group patients were compared with 125 control and 1,283 preintervention patients. Compared with control, prompting increased median ventilator-free duration, decreased empirical antibiotic and central venous catheter duration, and increased rates of deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Prompted group patients had lower risk-adjusted ICU mortality compared with the control group (odds ratio, 0.36; 95\% confidence interval, 0.13-0.96; P = 0.041) and lower hospital mortality compared with the control group (10.0 vs. 20.8\%; P = 0.014), which remained significant after risk adjustment (odds ratio, 0.34; 95\% confidence interval, 0.15-0.76; P = 0.008). Observed-to-predicted ICU length of stay was lower in the prompted group compared with control (0.59 vs. 0.87; P = 0.02). Checklist availability alone did not improve mortality or length of stay compared with preintervention patients.In this single-site, preliminary study, checklist-based prompting improved multiple processes of care, and may have improved mortality and length of stay, compared with a stand-alone checklist. The manner in which checklists are implemented is of great consequence in the care of critically ill patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Most implementations of multiple imputation (MI) of missing data are designed for simple rectangular data structures ignoring temporal ordering of data. Therefore, when applying MI to longitudinal data with intermittent patterns of missing data, some alternative strategies must be considered. One approach is to divide data into time blocks and implement MI independently at each block. An alternative approach is to include all time blocks in the same MI model. With increasing numbers of time blocks, this approach is likely to break down because of co-linearity and over-fitting. The new two-fold fully conditional specification (FCS) MI algorithm addresses these issues, by only conditioning on measurements, which are local in time. We describe and report the results of a novel simulation study to critically evaluate the two-fold FCS algorithm and its suitability for imputation of longitudinal electronic health records. After generating a full data set, approximately 70\% of selected continuous and categorical variables were made missing completely at random in each of ten time blocks. Subsequently, we applied a simple time-to-event model. We compared efficiency of estimated coefficients from a complete records analysis, MI of data in the baseline time block and the two-fold FCS algorithm. The results show that the two-fold FCS algorithm maximises the use of data available, with the gain relative to baseline MI depending on the strength of correlations within and between variables. Using this approach also increases plausibility of the missing at random assumption by using repeated measures over time of variables whose baseline values may be missing.},

  Abstract                 = {Few contemporary population-based data exist about the incidence, patient characteristics, and outcomes of mechanical ventilation in acute care hospitals. We sought to describe the epidemiology of mechanical ventilation use in the United States.Retrospective cohort study using year 2005 hospital discharge records from six states. National projections were generated from age-, race-, and sex-specific rates in the cohort.Nonfederal acute care hospitals.All discharges that included invasive mechanical ventilation identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes (96.7x).None.Of 6,469,674 hospitalizations in the six states, 180,326 (2.8\%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. There was a wide age distribution with 52.2\% of patients <65 yrs of age. A total of 44.6\% had at least one major comorbid condition. The most common comorbidities included diabetes (13.2\%) and pulmonary disease (13.2\%). Inhospital mortality was 34.5\%, and only 30.8\% of patients were discharged home from the hospital. Almost all patients received care in urban (73.5\%) or suburban (23.6\%) hospitals vs. rural hospitals (2.9\%). Patients in urban hospitals experienced a higher number of organ dysfunctions, more dialysis and tracheostomies, and higher mortality compared with patients in rural hospitals. Projecting to national estimates, there were 790,257 hospitalizations involving mechanical ventilation in 2005, representing 2.7 episodes of mechanical ventilation per 1000 population. Estimated national costs were $27 billion representing 12\% of all hospital costs. Incidence, mortality, and cumulative population costs rose significantly with age.Mechanical ventilation use is common and accounts for a disproportionate amount of resource use, particularly in urban hospitals and in elderly patients. Mortality for mechanically ventilated patients is high. Quality improvement and cost-reduction strategies targeted at these patients are warranted.},

Every year, data collected from biomedical and behavioral science is getting larger and more complicated. Thus, in medicine, we also need to be aware of this trend and understand the statistical tools that are available to analyze these datasets. Many statistical analyses that are aimed to analyze such big datasets have been introduced recently. However, given many different types of clinical, genomic, and environmental data, it is rather uncommon to see statistical methods that combine knowledge resulting from those different data types. To this extent, we will introduce big data in terms of clinical data, single nucleotide polymorphism and gene expression studies and their interactions with environment. In this article, we will introduce the concept of well-known regression analyses such as linear and logistic regressions that has been widely used in clinical data analyses and modern statistical models such as Bayesian networks that has been introduced to analyze more complicated data. Also we will discuss how to represent the interaction among clinical, genomic, and environmental data in using modern statistical models. We conclude this article with a promising modern statistical method called Bayesian networks that is suitable in analyzing big data sets that consists with different type of large data from clinical, genomic, and environmental data. Such statistical model form big data will provide us with more comprehensive understanding of human physiology and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The rising prevalence of rapid response teams has led to a demand for risk-stratification tools that can estimate a ward patient's risk of clinical deterioration and subsequent need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Finding such a risk-stratification tool is crucial for maximizing the utility of rapid response teams. This study compares the ability of nine risk prediction scores in detecting clinical deterioration among non-ICU ward patients. We also measured each score serially to characterize how these scores changed with time.In a retrospective nested case-control study, we calculated nine well-validated prediction scores for 328 cases and 328 matched controls. Our cohort included non-ICU ward patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of infection, and cases were patients in this cohort who experienced clinical deterioration, defined as requiring a critical care consult, ICU admission, or death. We then compared each prediction score's ability, over the course of 72 hours, to discriminate between cases and controls.At 0 to 12 hours before clinical deterioration, seven of the nine scores performed with acceptable discrimination: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score area under the curve of 0.78, Predisposition/Infection/Response/Organ Dysfunction Score of 0.76, VitalPac Early Warning Score of 0.75, Simple Clinical Score of 0.74, Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis of 0.74, Modified Early Warning Score of 0.73, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II of 0.73, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II of 0.72, and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score of 0.67. By measuring scores over time, it was found that average SOFA scores of cases increased as early as 24 to 48 hours prior to deterioration (P = 0.01). Finally, a clinical prediction rule which also accounted for the change in SOFA score was constructed and found to perform with a sensitivity of 75\% and a specificity of 72\%, and this performance is better than that of any SOFA scoring model based on a single set of physiologic variables.ICU- and emergency room-based prediction scores can also be used to prognosticate risk of clinical deterioration for non-ICU ward patients. In addition, scoring models that take advantage of a score's change over time may have increased prognostic value over models that use only a single set of physiologic measurements.},
