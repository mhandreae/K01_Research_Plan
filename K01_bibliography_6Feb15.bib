  Abstract                 = {Regional anaesthesia may reduce the rate of persistent (chronic) pain after surgery, a frequent and debilitating condition.To compare local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia for the prevention of persistent pain six or 12 months after surgery.We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), PubMed (1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (1966 to May 2012) and CINAHL (1966 to May 2012) without any language restriction. We used a combination of free text search and controlled vocabulary search. The results were limited to randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). We conducted a handsearch in reference lists of included trials, review articles and conference abstracts.We included RCTs comparing local anaesthetics or regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia with a pain outcome at six or 12 months after surgery.Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, including information on adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional information. Results are presented as pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI), based on random-effects models (inverse variance method). We grouped studies according to surgical interventions. We employed the Chi(2) test and calculated the I(2) statistic to investigate study heterogeneity.We identified 23 RCTs studying local anaesthetics or regional anaesthesia for the prevention of persistent (chronic) pain after surgery. Data from a total of 1090 patients with outcomes at six months and of 441 patients with outcomes at 12 months were presented. No study included children. We pooled data from 250 participants after thoracotomy, with outcomes at six months. Data favoured regional anaesthesia for the prevention of chronic pain at six months after thoracotomy with an OR of 0.33 (95\% CI 0.20 to 0.56). We pooled two studies on paravertebral block for breast cancer surgery; the pooled data of 89 participants with outcomes at five to six months favoured paravertebral block with an OR of 0.37 (95\% CI 0.14 to 0.94).The methodological quality of the included studies was intermediate. Adverse effects were not studied systematically and were reported sparsely. Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered the assessment of effects, especially at 12 months.Epidural anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing chronic pain after thoracotomy in about one patient out of every four patients treated. Paravertebral block may reduce the risk of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery in about one out of every five women treated. Our conclusions are significantly weakened by performance bias, shortcomings in allocation concealment, considerable attrition and incomplete outcome data. We caution that our evidence synthesis is based on only a few, small studies. More studies with high methodological quality, addressing various types of surgery and different age groups, including children, are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Persistent postmastectomy pain (PPMP) is increasingly recognized as a major individual and public health problem. Although previous studies have investigated surgical, medical, and demographic risk factors, in this study we aimed to more clearly elucidate the relationship of psychosocial factors to PPMP. Postmastectomy patients (611) were queried about pain location, severity, and burden 38.3 plus minus 35.4 months postoperatively. Validated questionnaires for depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep, perceived stress, emotional stability, somatization, and catastrophizing were administered. Detailed surgical, medical, and treatment information was abstracted from patients' medical records. One third (32.5\%) of patients reported PPMP, defined as > 3/10 pain severity in the breast, axilla, side, or arm, which did not vary according to time since surgery. Multiple regression analysis revealed significant and independent associations between PPMP and psychosocial factors, including catastrophizing, somatization, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. Conversely, treatment-related factors including surgical type, axillary node dissection, surgical complication, recurrence, tumor size, radiation, and chemotherapy were not significantly associated with PPMP. These data confirm previous studies suggesting that PPMP is relatively common and provide new evidence of significant associations between psychosocial characteristics such as catastrophizing with PPMP, regardless of the surgical and medical treatment that patients receive, which may lead to novel strategies in PPMP prevention and treatment.This cross-sectional cohort study of 611 postmastectomy patients investigated severity, location, and frequency of pain a mean of 3.2 years after surgery. Significant associations between pain severity and individual psychosocial attributes such as catastrophizing were found, whereas demographic, surgical, medical, and treatment-related factors were not associated with persistent pain.},

  Abstract                 = {Acute postoperative pain is followed by persistent pain in 10-50\% of individuals after common operations, such as groin hernia repair, breast and thoracic surgery, leg amputation, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Since chronic pain can be severe in about 2-10\% of these patients, persistent postsurgical pain represents a major, largely unrecognised clinical problem. Iatrogenic neuropathic pain is probably the most important cause of long-term postsurgical pain. Consequently, surgical techniques that avoid nerve damage should be applied whenever possible. Also, the effect of aggressive, early therapy for postoperative pain should be investigated, since the intensity of acute postoperative pain correlates with the risk of developing a persistent pain state. Finally, the role of genetic factors should be studied, since only a proportion of patients with intraoperative nerve damage develop chronic pain. Based on information about the molecular mechanisms that affect changes to the peripheral and central nervous system in neuropathic pain, several opportunities exist for multimodal pharmacological intervention. Here, we outline strategies for identification of patients at risk and for prevention and possible treatment of this important entity of chronic pain.},

  Abstract                 = {Surgical injury can frequently lead to chronic pain. Despite the obvious importance of this problem, the first publications on chronic pain after surgery as a general topic appeared only a decade ago. This study tests the hypothesis that chronic postsurgical pain was, and still is, represented insufficiently.We analyzed the presentation of this topic in journal articles covered by PubMed and in surgical textbooks. The following signs of insufficient representation in journal articles were used: (1) the lack of journal editorials on chronic pain after surgery, (2) the lack of journal articles with titles clearly indicating that they are devoted to chronic postsurgical pain, and (3) the insufficient representation of chronic postsurgical pain in the top surgical journals.It was demonstrated that insufficient representation of this topic existed in 1981-2000, especially in surgical journals and textbooks. Interest in this topic began to increase, however, mostly regarding one specific surgery: herniorrhaphy. It is important that the change in the attitude toward chronic postsurgical pain spreads to other groups of surgeries.Chronic postsurgical pain is still a neglected topic, except for pain after herniorrhaphy. The change in the attitude toward chronic postsurgical pain is the important first step in the approach to this problem.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been considerable interest and controversy around persistent postoperative pain for several years. Most of the available data arise from studies with methodological problems (especially its definition in terms of duration, severity, and effect on quality of life and function); however, more recent investigations have begun to address these issues. Although the quoted incidence varies considerably, analysis of the most conservative data shows that there is no doubt that persistent postoperative pain is a significant clinical problem and a burden to those who suffer from it. There is a wealth of literature describing factors associated with increased likelihood of persistent postoperative pain. Although it is difficult to be precise, it is clear that psychosocial factors probably play a role in some situations and that significant preoperative pain, severe immediate postoperative pain, and nerve damage are often good predictors. There are some data indicating that the incidence and severity of persistent postoperative pain can be reduced by special perioperative interventions; however, as yet, the evidence is not compelling and consistent. A reliable prevention strategy is not yet emerging from the published literature and considerably more work is required to deliver this.},

  Abstract                 = {Interindividual variability in pain perception and analgesic response is a major problem in perioperative practice. Adult studies suggest pain management is influenced by patient's race. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of race on perioperative pain treatment in children.Prospective observational study evaluating effect of race on analgesia and opioid related adverse effects after tonsillectomy in African American and Caucasian children. A sample of 194 healthy children between 6 and 15 years of age were included. Race was self-identified by parents. All participants received standard perioperative care with a standard anesthetic and an intraoperative dose of morphine. Analgesia outcomes included maximum postoperative pain scores, postoperative opioid requirement, and analgesic interventions. Safety outcomes included incidences of opioid related adverse effects.African American children experienced significantly more postoperative pain than Caucasian children as measured by postoperative opioid requirement (P = .0011), maximum postoperative pain scores (P < .0001), and analgesic interventions (P < .0001) in the recovery room. Although Caucasian children received relatively less opioids perioperatively, they had significantly higher opioid related adverse effects (P = .039). African American children with obstructive sleep apnea were more likely to have prolonged post anesthesia recovery unit stay due to inadequate pain control.After similar uses of intraoperative morphine for tonsillectomy, there was an unequal burden of increased pain in African American children and increased opioid adverse effects in Caucasian children in the recovery room. Though Caucasian children received relatively less opioids perioperatively, they had higher incidences of opioid related adverse effects than African American children.},

  Abstract                 = {There is paucity of data regarding patient selection criteria, anaesthetic preferences and outcomes of elective inguinal hernia repair in public and private sector in the UK. This study aimed to compare such outcomes.Five hundred and fifty-five consecutive inguinal hernia repairs performed by one consultant surgeon in public and private sector were reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. The patient demographics, anaesthetic choice, day case rates and early and long-term morbidity were analysed.The median age of the study group was 59 years (range 16-96 years) with a male/female ratio of 21:1. A total of 436 (78 \%) patients underwent surgery in the public sector and 119 (22 \%) patients in the private sector. The patients undergoing surgery in the private sector were younger compared to public sector (55 vs. 60 years, p = 0.03). The number of patients with ASA grades III and IV was higher in public sector (28.6 \%) compared to private sector (p = 0.0001). General anaesthesia was the preferred anaesthetic technique in the private sector (52 \%) and local anaesthesia in the public sector (66 \%) (p = 0.0002). The day case rates were higher than in the private sector compared to public sector (78 vs. 66.5 \%, p = 0.01). No significant difference was noted in the incidence of post-operative complications, recurrence, groin pain and satisfaction rate between the two groups.Patients undergoing surgery in the private sector are younger, healthier, prefer general anaesthesia and have higher day case rates compared to public sector. The short- and long-term outcomes are similar between public and private sectors.},

Differences relating to specific drug effects, comorbidities and outcomes after anesthesia or intensive care have been demonstrated. There is a gender bias in diagnosis and therapy. While knowledge regarding this field is still growing, certain aspects have already been integrated into clinical practice (prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting, target-controlled infusion, male-only policy with production of blood products). There is a need to study the influence of gender, age, and race on perioperative outcome to optimize treatment and move toward more individualized therapy. This article highlights already identified differences and discusses potential underlying mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Missing data are common in longitudinal studies due to drop-out, loss to follow-up, and death. Likelihood-based mixed effects models for longitudinal data give valid estimates when the data are missing at random (MAR). These assumptions, however, are not testable without further information. In some studies, there is additional information available in the form of an auxiliary variable known to be correlated with the missing outcome of interest. Availability of such auxiliary information provides us with an opportunity to test the MAR assumption. If the MAR assumption is violated, such information can be utilized to reduce or eliminate bias when the missing data process depends on the unobserved outcome through the auxiliary information. We compare two methods of utilizing the auxiliary information: joint modeling of the outcome of interest and the auxiliary variable, and multiple imputation (MI). Simulation studies are performed to examine the two methods. The likelihood-based joint modeling approach is consistent and most efficient when correctly specified. However, mis-specification of the joint distribution can lead to biased results. MI is slightly less efficient than a correct joint modeling approach and can also be biased when the imputation model is mis-specified, though it is more robust to mis-specification of the imputation distribution when all the variables affecting the missing data mechanism and the missing outcome are included in the imputation model. An example is presented from a dementia screening study.},
