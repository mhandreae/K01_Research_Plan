  Abstract                 = {The majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS is mediated by tetrameric AMPA receptors. Channel activation begins with a series of interactions with an agonist that binds to the cleft between the two lobes of the ligand-binding domain of each subunit. Binding leads to a series of conformational transitions, including the closure of the two lobes of the binding domain around the ligand, culminating in ion channel opening. Although a great deal has been learned from crystal structures, determining the molecular details of channel activation, deactivation, and desensitization requires measures of dynamics and stabilities of hydrogen bonds that stabilize cleft closure. The use of hydrogen-deuterium exchange at low pH provides a measure of the variation of stability of specific hydrogen bonds among agonists of different efficacy. Here, we used NMR measurements of hydrogen-deuterium exchange to determine the stability of hydrogen bonds in the GluA2 (AMPA receptor) ligand-binding domain in the presence of several full and partial agonists. The results suggest that the stabilization of hydrogen bonds between the two lobes of the binding domain is weaker for partial than for full agonists, and efficacy is correlated with the stability of these hydrogen bonds. The closure of the lobes around the agonists leads to a destabilization of the hydrogen bonding in another portion of the lobe interface, and removing an electrostatic interaction in Lobe 2 can relieve the strain. These results provide new details of transitions in the binding domain that are associated with channel activation and desensitization.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Despite concern over the appropriateness and quality of care provided in an intensive care unit (ICU) at the end of life, the number of Americans who receive ICU care at the end of life is unknown. We sought to describe the use of ICU care at the end of life in the United States using hospital discharge data from 1999 for six states and the National Death Index. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of administrative data to calculate age-specific rates of hospitalization with and without ICU use at the end of life, to generate national estimates of end-of-life hospital and ICU use, and to characterize age-specific case mix of ICU decedents. SETTING: All nonfederal hospitals in the states of Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Washington. PATIENTS: All inpatients in nonfederal hospitals in the six states in 1999. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found that there were 552,157 deaths in the six states in 1999, of which 38.3% occurred in hospital and 22.4% occurred after ICU admission. Using these data to project nationwide estimates, 540,000 people die after ICU admission each year. The age-specific rate of ICU use at the end of life was highest for infants (43%), ranged from 18% to 26% among older children and adults, and fell to 14% for those >85 yrs. Average length of stay and costs were 12.9 days and $24,541 for terminal ICU hospitalizations and 8.9 days and $8,548 for non-ICU terminal hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: One in five Americans die using ICU services. The doubling of persons over the age of 65 yrs by 2030 will require a system-wide expansion in ICU care for dying patients unless the healthcare system pursues rationing, more effective advanced care planning, and augmented capacity to care for dying patients in other settings.},

A recently proposed bundle of practices for the intensive care unit could advance the current practice environment toward this idealized environment. The Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium Monitoring and Management, and Early Mobility (ABCDE) bundle incorporates the best available evidence related to delirium, immobility, sedation/analgesia, and ventilator management in the intensive care unit for adoption into everyday clinical practice.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) transfers may result from errors in care but the frequency of their occurrence, and whether these transfers might be prevented, has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To determine why unplanned transfers occur, what fraction results from errors in care, whether they are preceded by changes in clinical status and if so, whether earlier or different responses might prevent the transfers. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: All patients 18 to 89 years with unplanned transfers to the medical ICU from June 1, 2005 to May 30, 2006. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Demographics, admission and transfer diagnoses, clinical triggers preceding the transfer, mortality, judgment by three reviewers about cause of transfer and whether it could have been prevented. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients had unplanned transfers. The most common reasons were worsening of the problem for which the patient was admitted (48%) and development of a new problem (39%). Errors in care accounted for 29 transfers (19%), 15 of which were due to incorrect triage at the time of admission, and 14 due to iatrogenic errors. Of the 14 iatrogenic errors, the investigators determined that eight transfers might have been prevented by an earlier intervention. Agreement among the three reviewers was moderate to almost perfect (kappa 0.55-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Although 19% of unplanned transfers to medical ICUs are associated with errors in care, almost 80% of these seem to be preventable. Most of the preventable errors resulted from inappropriate admission triage.},

What is the value and role of ICU mortality prediction models for informing the utility of ICU care?In this article, we review the history, statistical underpinnings,and current deployment of these models in clinical care. We conclude that the use of outcome prediction models to ration care that is unlikely to provide an expected benefit is hampered by imperfect performance, the lack of real-time availability, failure to consider functional outcomes beyond survival, and physician resistance to the use of probabilistic information when death is guaranteed by the decision it informs. Among these barriers, the most important technical deficiency is the lack of automated information systems to provide outcome predictions to decision makers, and the most important research and policy agenda is to understand and address our national ambivalence toward rationing care based on any criterion.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To revise the "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Sustained Use of Sedatives and Analgesics in the Critically Ill Adult" published in Critical Care Medicine in 2002. METHODS: The American College of Critical Care Medicine assembled a 20-person, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional task force with expertise in guideline development, pain, agitation and sedation, delirium management, and associated outcomes in adult critically ill patients. The task force, divided into four subcommittees, collaborated over six years in person, via teleconferences, and via electronic communication. Subcommittees were responsible for developing relevant clinical questions, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method (www.gradeworkinggroup.org) to review, evaluate, and summarize the literature, and to develop clinical statements (descriptive) and recommendations (actionable). With the help of a professional librarian and Refworks database software, they developed a Web-based electronic database of over 19,000 references extracted from eight clinical search engines, related to pain and analgesia, agitation and sedation, delirium, and related clinical outcomes in adult ICU patients. The group also used psychometric analyses to evaluate and compare pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium assessment tools. All task force members were allowed to review the literature supporting each statement and recommendation and provided feedback to the subcommittees. Group consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations using the nominal group technique and the modified Delphi method, with anonymous voting by all task force members using E-Survey (www.esurvey.com). All voting was completed in December 2010. Relevant studies published after this date and prior to publication of these guidelines were referenced in the text. The quality of evidence for each statement and recommendation was ranked as high (A), moderate (B), or low/very low (C). The strength of recommendations was ranked as strong (1) or weak (2) and either in favor of (+) or against (-) an intervention. A strong recommendation (either for or against) indicated that the intervention's desirable effects either clearly outweighed its undesirable effects (risks, burdens, and costs) or it did not. For all strong recommendations, the phrase "We recommend..." is used throughout. A weak recommendation, either for or against an intervention, indicated that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects was less clear. For all weak recommendations, the phrase "We suggest..." is used throughout. In the absence of sufficient evidence, or when group consensus could not be achieved, no recommendation (0) was made. Consensus based on expert opinion was not used as a substitute for a lack of evidence. A consistent method for addressing potential conflicts of interest was followed if task force members were coauthors of related research. The development of this guideline was independent of any industry funding. CONCLUSION: These guidelines provide a roadmap for developing integrated, evidence-based, and patient-centered protocols for preventing and treating pain, agitation, and delirium in critically ill patients.},

The strength of recommendations was ranked as strong (1) or weak (2), and either in favor of (+) or against (-) an intervention. A strong recommendation (either for or against) indicated that the intervention's desirable effects either clearly outweighed its undesirable effects (risks, burdens, and costs) or it did not. For all strong recommendations, the phrase "We recommend ..." is used throughout. A weak recommendation, either for or against an intervention, indicated that the trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects was less clear. For all weak recommendations, the phrase "We suggest ..." is used throughout. In the absence of sufficient evidence, or when group consensus could not be achieved, no recommendation (0) was made. Consensus based on expert opinion was not used as a substitute for a lack of evidence. A consistent method for addressing potential conflict of interest was followed if task force members were coauthors of related research. The development of this guideline was independent of any industry funding. CONCLUSION: These guidelines provide a roadmap for developing integrated, evidence-based, and patient-centered protocols for preventing and treating pain, agitation, and delirium in critically ill patients.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The benefits and use of low-dose corticosteroids (LDCs) in severe sepsis and septic shock remain controversial. Surviving sepsis campaign guidelines suggest LDC use for septic shock patients poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Their use is suspected to be wide-spread, but paucity of data regarding global practice exists. The purpose of this study was to compare baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients treated or not treated with LDC from the international PROGRESS (PROmoting Global Research Excellence in Severe Sepsis) cohort study of severe sepsis. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the PROGRESS registry were evaluated for use of vasopressor and LDC (equivalent or lesser potency to hydrocortisone 50 mg six-hourly plus 50 microg 9-alpha-fludrocortisone) for treatment of severe sepsis at any time in intensive care units (ICUs). Baseline characteristics and hospital mortality were analyzed, and logistic regression techniques used to develop propensity score and outcome models adjusted for baseline imbalances between groups. RESULTS: A total of 8,968 patients with severe sepsis and sufficient data for analysis were studied. A total of 79.8% (7,160/8,968) of patients received vasopressors, and 34.0% (3,051/8,968) of patients received LDC. Regional use of LDC was highest in Europe (51.1%) and lowest in Asia (21.6%). Country use was highest in Brazil (62.9%) and lowest in Malaysia (9.0%). A total of 14.2% of patients on LDC were not receiving any vasopressor therapy. LDC patients were older, had more co-morbidities and higher disease severity scores. Patients receiving LDC spent longer in ICU than patients who did not (median of 12 versus 8 days; P <0.001). Overall hospital mortality rates were greater in the LDC than in the non-LDC group (58.0% versus 43.0%; P <0.001). After adjusting for baseline imbalances, in all mortality models (with vasopressor use), a consistent association remained between LDC and hospital mortality (odds ratios varying from 1.30 to 1.47). CONCLUSIONS: Widespread use of LDC for the treatment of severe sepsis with significant regional and country variation exists. In this study, 14.2% of patients received LDC despite the absence of evidence of shock. Hospital mortality was higher in the LDC group and remained higher after adjustment for key determinates of mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: The value of good end-of-life (EOL) care could be underestimated if its effects are assessed using the standard metric of quality-adjusted survival, especially if the time horizon is limited to the duration of the EOL care. This issue is particularly problematic in the intensive-care unit (ICU) where death is frequent, care is difficult, and costs are high. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to test whether people would trade healthy life expectancy for better EOL care, to understand how much life expectancy they would trade relative to domains of good care, and to determine the association of respondent characteristics to time traded. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We used a computerized survey instrument describing hypothetical patient experiences in the ICU used to assess attitudes of a general population sample (n = 104) recruited in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. MEASURES: We used life expectancy traded (from a baseline of 80 healthy years followed by a 1-month fatal ICU stay) for improving ICU care in 4 domains: pain and discomfort, daily surroundings, treatment decisions, and family support. RESULTS: Three fourths of respondents (n = 78) were prepared to shorten healthy life for better EOL care. Median time traded in individual domains ranged from 7.2 to 7.7 months overall and 9.6 to 11.4 months when restricted to those willing to trade. Median time traded for improvement in all domains was 8.3 months overall and 24.0 months by those willing to trade. In multivariable analyses, respondents who were older, nonwhite, or had children traded significantly less time, whereas those who did not perceive the ICU to be a caring environment traded more time. CONCLUSIONS: Good EOL care is highly valued, both in terms of medical and nonmedical domains, as suggested by previous work and confirmed by our data showing respondents trading quantities of healthy life several times longer than the duration of the EOL period itself. The considerable interperson variation highlights the importance of soliciting individual preferences about EOL care.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Significant deficiencies exist in the communication of prognosis for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after acute illness, in part because of clinician uncertainty about long-term outcomes. We sought to refine a mortality prediction model for patients requiring prolonged ventilation using a multicentered study design. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Five geographically diverse tertiary care medical centers in the United States (California, Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Washington). PATIENTS: Two hundred sixty adult patients who received at least 21 days of mechanical ventilation after acute illness. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For the probability model, we included age, platelet count, and requirement for vasopressors and/or hemodialysis, each measured on day 21 of mechanical ventilation, in a logistic regression model with 1-yr mortality as the outcome variable. We subsequently modified a simplified prognostic scoring rule (ProVent score) by categorizing the risk variables (age 18-49, 50-64, and >/=65 yrs; platelet count 0-150 and >150; vasopressors; hemodialysis) in another logistic regression model and assigning points to variables according to beta coefficient values. Overall mortality at 1 yr was 48%. The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve for the primary ProVent probability model was 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.75-0.81), and the p value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic was .89. The area under the curve for the categorical model was 0.77, and the p value for the goodness-of-fit statistic was .34. The area under the curve for the ProVent score was 0.76, and the p value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic was .60. For the 50 patients with a ProVent score >2, only one patient was able to be discharged directly home, and 1-yr mortality was 86%. CONCLUSION: The ProVent probability model is a simple and reproducible model that can accurately identify patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation who are at high risk of 1-yr mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: ICU services represent a significant and increasing proportion of medical care. Population-based epidemiologic studies are essential to inform physicians and policymakers about current and future ICU demands. We aimed to determine the incidence of critical care syndromes, organ failures, and life-support interventions in a defined US suburban community with unrestricted access to critical care services. METHODS: This population-based observational cohort from January 1 to December 31, 2006, in Olmsted County, Minnesota, included all consecutive critically ill adult residents admitted to the ICU. Main outcomes were incidence of critical care syndromes, life-support interventions, and organ failures as defined by standard criteria. Incidences are reported per 100,000 population (95% CIs) and were age adjusted to the 2006 US population. RESULTS: A total of 1,707 ICU admissions were identified from 1,461 patients. Incidences of critical care syndromes were respiratory failure, 430 (390-470); acute kidney injury, 290 (257-323); severe sepsis, 286 (253-319); all-cause shock, 194 (167-221); acute lung injury, 86 (68-105); all-cause coma, 43 (30-55); and overt disseminated intravascular coagulation, 18 (10-26). Incidence of mechanical ventilation was invasive, 310 (276-344); noninvasive, 180 (154-206); vasopressors and inotropes, 183(155-208). Renal replacement therapy incidence was 96 (77-116). Of the cohort, 1,330 patients (91%) survived to hospital discharge. Short- and long-term survival decreased by the number of failing organs. CONCLUSIONS: In a suburban US community with high access to critical care services, cumulative incidences of critical care syndromes and life-support interventions were higher than previously reported. The results of this study have important implications for future planning of critical care delivery.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) and associated with a high mortality. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a medical-surgical ICU. Multiple interventions to optimize VAP prevention were performed from October 2008 to December 2010. All of these processes, including the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) ventilator bundle plus oral decontamination with chlorhexidine and continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions (CASS), were adopted for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 21,984 patient-days, and a total of 6,052 ventilator-days (ventilator utilization rate of 0.27). We found VAP rates of 1.3 and 2.0 per 1,000 ventilator days respectively in 2009 and 2010, achieving zero incidence of VAP several times during 12 months, whenever VAP bundle compliance was over 90%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that it is possible to reduce VAP rates to near zero and sustain these rates, but it requires a complex process involving multiple performance measures and interventions that must be permanently monitored.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE:: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year and many of these events may be preventable. Current vital sign-based risk scores for ward patients have demonstrated limited accuracy, which leads to missed opportunities to identify those patients most likely to suffer cardiac arrest and inefficient resource utilization. We derived and validated a prediction model for cardiac arrest while treating ICU transfer as a competing risk using electronic health record data. DESIGN:: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING:: An academic medical center in the United States with approximately 500 inpatient beds. PATIENTS:: Adult patients hospitalized from November 2008 until August 2011 who had documented ward vital signs. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Vital sign, demographic, location, and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic health record and investigated as potential predictor variables. A person-time multinomial logistic regression model was used to simultaneously predict cardiac arrest and ICU transfer. The prediction model was compared to the VitalPAC Early Warning Score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and was validated using three-fold cross-validation. A total of 56,649 controls, 109 cardiac arrest patients, and 2,543 ICU transfers were included. The derived model more accurately detected cardiac arrest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.88 vs 0.78; p < 0.001) and ICU transfer (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 vs 0.73; p < 0.001) than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score, and accuracy was similar with cross-validation. At a specificity of 93%, our model had a higher sensitivity than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score for cardiac arrest patients (65% vs 41%). CONCLUSIONS:: We developed and validated a prediction tool for ward patients that can simultaneously predict the risk of cardiac arrest and ICU transfer. Our model was more accurate than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score and could be implemented in the electronic health record to alert caregivers with real-time information regarding patient deterioration.},

PARTICIPANTS: Attending staff, house staff, and intensive care unit (ICU) nurses in 37 Canadian university-affiliated hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health care workers' ratings of the importance of 17 factors considered in the decision to withdraw life support, and their ratings of five levels of care ranging from comfort measures to intensive care in two of 12 different clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We surveyed 1361 respondents (149 of 167 potentially eligible ICU attending staff, 142 of 173 ICU house staff, and 1070 of 1455 ICU nurses, with response rates of 89%, 82% and 74%, respectively). The most important factors were likelihood of surviving the current episode, likelihood of long-term survival, premorbid cognitive function, and age of the patient. In choosing the level of care for the patient scenarios, the same option was chosen by more than 50% of respondents in only one of 12 scenarios; opposite extremes of care were chosen by more than 10% of the respondents in eight of 12 scenarios. Respondent characteristics affecting choices included the number of years since graduation, the city and province in which they worked, the number of beds in their ICU, and their assessment of the likelihood that they would withdraw life support in comparison with their colleagues (P < .001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: While ICU health care workers consistently identify a number of patient factors as important in decisions to withdraw care, there is extreme variability, which may be explained in part by the values of individual health care providers.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that mechanical ventilation contributes to the development of acute kidney injury (AKI), particularly in the setting of lung-injurious ventilator strategies. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ventilator settings in critically ill patients without acute lung injury (ALI) at onset of mechanical ventilation affect the development of AKI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (N = 150), comparing conventional tidal volume (V(T), 10 mL/kg) with low tidal volume (V(T), 6 mL/kg) mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients without ALI at randomization. During the first 5 days of mechanical ventilation, the RIFLE class was determined daily, whereas neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin C levels were measured in plasma collected on days 0, 2, and 4. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients had no AKI at inclusion, and 18 patients (21%) subsequently developed AKI, but without significant difference between ventilation strategies. (Cumulative hazard, 0.26 vs 0.23; P = .88.) The courses of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin C plasma levels did not differ significantly between randomization groups. CONCLUSION: In the present study in critically patients without ALI at onset of mechanical ventilation, lower tidal volume ventilation did not reduce the development or worsening of AKI compared with conventional tidal volume ventilation.},

  Abstract                 = {This article describes the increasingly common phenomenon of prolonged mechanical ventilation in the context of the transition between the acute care hospital and post-acute care. Prolonged mechanical ventilation or chronic critical illness is associated with hospital mortality in the range of 20 to 40%, with median hospital length of stay ranging from 14 to 60 days. Fewer than 10% of patients are discharged home, and most hospital survivors require institutionalized post-acute care in the form of long-term acute care, skilled nursing facilities, or inpatient rehabilitation. Acute hospital readmission is common. Because of prolonged functional disabilities and multiple underlying comorbid conditions, overall 1 year mortality for prolonged mechanical ventilation patients ranges from 50 to 60%. Survivors experience significant functional limitations. The prolonged institutional care and poor long-term outcomes of these patients bring into question the cost-effectiveness of prolonged mechanical ventilation after acute illness, especially for patients with poor long-term prognoses. New measures to facilitate assessments of long-term prognosis and improve communication with surrogate decision makers may reduce the amount of ineffective care for some patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Shared decision making is inadequate in intensive care units. Decision aids can improve decision making quality, though their role in an intensive care units setting is unclear. We aimed to develop and pilot test a decision aid for shared decision makers of patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation. SETTING: Intensive care units at three medical centers. SUBJECTS: Fifty-three surrogate decision makers and 58 physicians. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: We developed the decision aid using defined methodological guidelines. After an iterative revision process, formative cognitive testing was performed among surrogate-physician dyads. Next, we compared the decision aid to usual care control in a prospective, before/after design study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were physician-surrogate discordance for expected patient survival, comprehension of relevant medical information, and the quality of communication. Compared to control, the intervention group had lower surrogate-physician discordance (7 [10] vs. 43 [21]), greater comprehension (11.4 [0.7] vs. 6.1 [3.7]), and improved quality of communication (8.7 [1.3] vs. 8.4 [1.3]) (all p<.05) post-intervention. Hospital costs were lower in the intervention group ($110,609 vs. $178,618; p=.044); mortality did not differ by group (38% vs. 50%, p=.95). Ninety-four percent of the surrogates and 100% of the physicians reported that the decision aid was useful in decision making. CONCLUSION: We developed a prolonged mechanical ventilation decision aid that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with both improved decision-making quality and less resource utilization. Further evaluation using a randomized controlled trial design is required to evaluate the decision aid's effect on long-term patient and surrogate outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Although electrophysiologic and histologic neuromuscular abnormalities are common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, the clinical incidence of ICU-acquired neuromuscular disorders in patients recovering from severe illness remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of ICU-acquired paresis (ICUAP) during recovery from critical illness in the ICU and to determine the electrophysiologic and histologic patterns in patients with ICUAP. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted from March 1999 to June 2000. SETTING: Three medical and 2 surgical ICUs in 4 hospitals in France. PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive ICU patients without preexisting neuromuscular disease who underwent mechanical ventilation for 7 or more days were screened daily for awakening. The first day a patient was considered awake was day 1. Patients with severe muscle weakness on day 7 were considered to have ICUAP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and duration of ICUAP, risk factors for ICUAP, and comparative duration of mechanical ventilation between ICUAP and control patients. RESULTS: Among the 95 patients who achieved satisfactory awakening, the incidence of ICUAP was 25.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.9%-35.2%). All ICUAP patients had a sensorimotor axonopathy, and all patients who underwent a muscle biopsy had specific muscle involvement not related to nerve involvement. The median duration of ICUAP after day 1 was 21 days. Mean (SD) duration of mechanical ventilation after day 1 was significantly longer in patients with ICUAP compared with those without (18.2 [36.3] vs 7.6 [19.2] days; P =.03). Independent predictors of ICUAP were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.66; 95% CI, 1.19-18.30), the number of days with dysfunction of 2 or more organs (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.11-1.49), duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.22), and administration of corticosteroids (OR, 14.90; 95% CI, 3.20-69.80) before day 1. CONCLUSIONS: Identified using simple bedside clinical criteria, ICUAP was frequent during recovery from critical illness and was associated with a prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Our findings suggest an important role of corticosteroids in the development of ICUAP.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Recent cohort studies have identified the use of large tidal volumes as a major risk factor for development of lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients without acute lung injury (ALI). We compared the effect of conventional with lower tidal volumes on pulmonary inflammation and development of lung injury in critically ill patients without ALI at the onset of mechanical ventilation. METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled nonblinded preventive trial comparing mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 10 ml versus 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight in critically ill patients without ALI at the onset of mechanical ventilation. The primary end point was cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma during mechanical ventilation. The secondary end point was the development of lung injury, as determined by consensus criteria for ALI, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients (74 conventional versus 76 lower tidal volume) were enrolled and analyzed. No differences were observed in lavage fluid cytokine levels at baseline between the randomization groups. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels decreased significantly more strongly in the lower-tidal-volume group ((from 51 (20 to 182) ng/ml to 11 (5 to 20) ng/ml versus 50 (21 to 122) ng/ml to 21 (20 to 77) ng/ml; P = 0.01)). The trial was stopped prematurely for safety reasons because the development of lung injury was higher in the conventional tidal-volume group as compared with the lower tidal-volume group (13.5% versus 2.6%; P = 0.01). Univariate analysis showed statistical relations between baseline lung-injury score, randomization group, level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), the number of transfused blood products, the presence of a risk factor for ALI, and baseline IL-6 lavage fluid levels and the development of lung injury. Multivariate analysis revealed the randomization group and the level of PEEP as independent predictors of the development of lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation with conventional tidal volumes is associated with sustained cytokine production, as measured in plasma. Our data suggest that mechanical ventilation with conventional tidal volumes contributes to the development of lung injury in patients without ALI at the onset of mechanical ventilation.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux and subsequent aspiration, can be reduced by semirecumbent body position in intensive-care patients. The objective of this study was to assess whether the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia can also be reduced by this measure. METHODS: This trial was stopped after the planned interim analysis. 86 intubated and mechanically ventilated patients of one medical and one respiratory intensive-care unit at a tertiary-care university hospital were randomly assigned to semirecumbent (n=39) or supine (n=47) body position. The frequency of clinically suspected and microbiologically confirmed nosocomial pneumonia (clinical plus quantitative bacteriological criteria) was assessed in both groups. Body position was analysed together with known risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia. FINDINGS: The frequency of clinically suspected nosocomial pneumonia was lower in the semirecumbent group than in the supine group (three of 39 [8%] vs 16 of 47 [34%]; 95% CI for difference 10.0-42.0, p=0.003). This was also true for microbiologically confirmed pneumonia (semirecumbent 2/39 [5%] vs supine 11/47 [23%]; 4.2-31.8, p=0.018). Supine body position (odds ratio 6.8 [1.7-26.7], p=0.006) and enteral nutrition (5.7 [1.5-22.8], p=0.013) were independent risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia and the frequency was highest for patients receiving enteral nutrition in the supine body position (14/28, 50%). Mechanical ventilation for 7 days or more (10.9 [3.0-40.4], p=0.001) and a Glasgow coma scale score of less than 9 were additional risk factors. INTERPRETATION: The semirecumbent body position reduces frequency and risk of nosocomial pneumonia, especially in patients who receive enteral nutrition. The risk of nosocomial pneumonia is increased by long-duration mechanical ventilation and decreased consciousness.},

We recorded epidemiologic data, severity scores, worst Pao(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)), presence of shock on ICU admission day, cause for MV, length of MV, ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS. PMV patients were compared to patients weaned before 21 days (non-PMV group) to determine predictors of PMV. RESULTS: Of 551 hospital admissions, 319 patients (58%) required MV > 12 h. One hundred thirty patients died early and were excluded. Seventy-nine patients (14%) required PMV. The non-PMV group consisted of 110 patients. Simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II, therapeutic intervention scoring system, Pao(2)/Fio(2), shock, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS differed significantly between groups. However, logistic regression identified shock on ICU admission day as the only independent predictor of PMV (odds ratio, 3.10; p = 0.001). SAPS II and Pao(2)/Fio(2) had the nearest coefficients and were used to build the predictive model. Sensitivity analysis was performed including the 130 patients who died early, and shock remained the most powerful predictor. CONCLUSIONS: PMV was a frequent event in this cohort. The presence of shock on ICU admission day was the only prognostic factor, even adjusting for severity of illness and hypoxemia.},

  Abstract                 = {Rationale: Predictions of duration of mechanical ventilation are frequently made by intensivists and influence clinical decisions. Objectives: We aimed to measure the accuracy of these clinical early predictions. Methods: One hundred and fifty-five patients within 48 hours of initiation of mechanical ventilation on a general Intensive Care Unit had clinical data prospectively collected and were followed to determine actual duration of mechanical ventilation. Intensivists, after evaluating patients in the first 2 consecutive days, predicted each duration of mechanical ventilation by selecting between <3, 4-7, 8-14 or >14 days. Accuracy of predictions was evaluated by comparisons between predicted and actual durations. Measurements and Main Results: Raw agreement (95% confidence interval) between predicted and actual durations, classified into the four categories, was 37% (29-45). Predictions of duration of > 7 and > 14 days showed raw agreements of 59%(51-66) and 83%(76-88); sensitivities of 40%(28-54) and 29%(13-51); specificities of 71%(61-80) and 93% (87-97); positive predictive values of 48%(34-63) and 44%(20-70); and negative predictive values of 64% (54-73) and 87% (81-92), respectively. Conclusions: The accuracy of intensivists' early clinical predictions of duration of mechanical ventilation is limited, particularly for identifying patients that will require prolonged mechanical ventilation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Lung-protective ventilation with the use of low tidal volumes and positive end-expiratory pressure is considered best practice in the care of many critically ill patients. However, its role in anesthetized patients undergoing major surgery is not known. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned 400 adults at intermediate to high risk of pulmonary complications after major abdominal surgery to either nonprotective mechanical ventilation or a strategy of lung-protective ventilation. The primary outcome was a composite of major pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications occurring within the first 7 days after surgery. RESULTS: The two intervention groups had similar characteristics at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 21 of 200 patients (10.5%) assigned to lung-protective ventilation, as compared with 55 of 200 (27.5%) assigned to nonprotective ventilation (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.68; P=0.001). Over the 7-day postoperative period, 10 patients (5.0%) assigned to lung-protective ventilation required noninvasive ventilation or intubation for acute respiratory failure, as compared with 34 (17.0%) assigned to nonprotective ventilation (relative risk, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.61; P=0.001). The length of the hospital stay was shorter among patients receiving lung-protective ventilation than among those receiving nonprotective ventilation (mean difference, -2.45 days; 95% CI, -4.17 to -0.72; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with a practice of nonprotective mechanical ventilation, the use of a lung-protective ventilation strategy in intermediate-risk and high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery was associated with improved clinical outcomes and reduced health care utilization.

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: The aging population may strain intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and adversely affect patient outcomes. Existing fluctuations in demand for ICU care offer an opportunity to explore such relationships. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether transient increases in ICU strain influence patient mortality, and to identify characteristics of ICUs that are resilient to surges in capacity strain. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 264,401 patients admitted to 155 U.S. ICUs from 2001 to 2008. We used logistic regression to examine relationships of measures of ICU strain (census, average acuity, and proportion of new admissions) near the time of ICU admission with mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 36,465 (14%) patients died in the hospital. ICU census on the day of a patient's admission was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.02 per standardized unit increase; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.03). This effect was greater among ICUs employing closed (OR, 1.07; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.12) versus open (OR, 1.01; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.03) physician staffing models (interaction P value = 0.02). The relationship between census and mortality was stronger when the census was composed of higher acuity patients (interaction P value < 0.01). Averaging strain over the first 3 days of patients' ICU stays yielded similar results except that the proportion of new admissions was now also associated with mortality (OR, 1.04 for each 10% increase; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.06). CONCLUSIONS: Several sources of ICU strain are associated with small but potentially important increases in patient mortality, particularly in ICUs employing closed staffing models. Although closed ICUs may promote favorable outcomes under static conditions, they are susceptible to being overwhelmed by patient influxes.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: Accurate, early identification of patients at risk for developing acute lung injury (ALI) provides the opportunity to test and implement secondary prevention strategies. Objectives: To determine the frequency and outcome of ALI development in patients at risk and validate a lung injury prediction score (LIPS). METHODS: In this prospective multicenter observational cohort study, predisposing conditions and risk modifiers predictive of ALI development were identified from routine clinical data available during initial evaluation. The discrimination of the model was assessed with area under receiver operating curve (AUC). The risk of death from ALI was determined after adjustment for severity of illness and predisposing conditions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two hospitals enrolled 5,584 patients at risk. ALI developed a median of 2 (interquartile range 1-4) days after initial evaluation in 377 (6.8%; 148 ALI-only, 229 adult respiratory distress syndrome) patients. The frequency of ALI varied according to predisposing conditions (from 3% in pancreatitis to 26% after smoke inhalation). LIPS discriminated patients who developed ALI from those who did not with an AUC of 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.82). When adjusted for severity of illness and predisposing conditions, development of ALI increased the risk of in-hospital death (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-5.7). CONCLUSIONS: ALI occurrence varies according to predisposing conditions and carries an independently poor prognosis. Using routinely available clinical data, LIPS identifies patients at high risk for ALI early in the course of their illness. This model will alert clinicians about the risk of ALI and facilitate testing and implementation of ALI prevention strategies. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00889772).},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE: Acute lung injury (ALI) that develops 6 hours after transfusion (TRALI) is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. Several transfusion characteristics have been postulated as risk factors for TRALI, but the evidence is limited to retrospective studies. OBJECTIVES: To compare patient and transfusion risk factors between patients who do and do not develop ALI. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, consecutive transfused critically ill patients were closely observed for development of ALI. Donor samples were collected from the transfusion bags. Risk factors were compared between patients who developed ALI after transfusion and transfused control patients, matched by age, sex, and admission diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-four of 901 transfused patients developed ALI within 6 hours of transfusion (8%). Compared with transfused control subjects, patients with ALI were more likely to have sepsis (37 vs. 22%, P = 0.016) and a history of chronic alcohol abuse (37 vs. 18%, P = 0.006). When adjusted for patient characteristics, transfusion of plasma from female donors (odds ratio [OR], 5.09; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.37-18.85) rather than male donors (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.76 to 3.37), number of pregnancies among the donors (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.34), number of donor units positive for anti-granulocyte antibodies (OR, 4.85; 95% CI, 1.32-17.86) and anti-HLA class II antibodies (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.15-8.25), and concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine in the donor product (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.59) were associated with the development of ALI. CONCLUSIONS: Both patient and transfusion risk factors determine the probability of ALI after transfusion. Transfusion factors represent attractive targets for the prevention of ALI.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To reduce the incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury (ALI), the American Association of Blood Banks recently recommended rapid implementation of strategies to minimize transfusion of high plasma volume components, fresh frozen plasma and apheresis platelets, from potentially alloimmunized donors, especially females. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of transfusing components from male-only vs. female donors on development of ALI, gas exchange, and outcome in critically ill patients. DESIGN: In this retrospective case-control study, we identified patients who received high plasma volume components from male-only donors and compared them with patients matched by severity of illness, postoperative state, and number of transfusions but who received high plasma volume components from female donors. SETTING: Four intensive care units at a tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients who received >2 units of fresh frozen plasma or apheresis platelets. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From a database of 3,567 patients who received a total of 46,101 units of fresh frozen plasma and 6,251 units of apheresis platelets, we identified 112 patients who received three or more male-only donor components and 112 matched controls. Baseline characteristics, ALI risk factors, and development of ALI were similar between the two groups. Arterial oxygenation (PaO2/FIO2) worsened after the female (mean difference -52, 95% confidence interval -14 to -91, p = .008) but not after male-only donor product transfusion (mean difference 22, 95% confidence interval -23 to 67, p = .325). Male-only component recipients had more ventilator-free days (median 28 vs. 27, p = .006) and a trend toward lower hospital mortality rates (14% vs. 24%, p = .054). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill recipients of high plasma volume components, gas exchange worsened significantly after transfusion of female but not male donor components. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effect of recommendations by the American Association of Blood Banks on outcome of transfused critically ill patients.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Physiological track and trigger warning systems (TTs) are used to identify patients outside critical care areas at risk of deterioration and to alert a senior clinician, Critical Care Outreach Service, or equivalent. The aims of this work were: to describe published TTs and the extent to which each has been developed according to established procedures; to review the published evidence and available data on the reliability, validity and utility of existing systems; and to identify the best TT for timely recognition of critically ill patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review of studies identified from electronic, citation and hand searching, and expert informants. Cohort study of data from 31 acute hospitals in England and Wales. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six papers were identified describing 25 distinct TTs. Thirty-one papers described the use of a TT, and five were studies examining the development or testing of TTs. None of the studies met all methodological quality standards. For the cohort study, outcome was measured by a composite of death, admission to critical care, 'do not attempt resuscitation' or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Fifteen datasets met pre-defined quality criteria. Sensitivities and positive predictive values were low, with median (quartiles) of 43.3 (25.4-69.2) and 36.7 (29.3-43.8), respectively. CONCLUSION: A wide variety of TTs were in use, with little evidence of reliability, validity and utility. Sensitivity was poor, which might be due in part to the nature of the physiology monitored or to the choice of trigger threshold. Available data were insufficient to identify the best TT.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between cigarette smoking and quality of life (QOL) among lung cancer survivors as measured by the lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS). DESIGN AND SETTING: The LCSS was mailed to eligible patients (1,506 patients) between 1999 and 2002. LCSS scores (total and individual QOL components) were compared among different groups of cigarette smokers via univariate independent group testing and multivariate linear models. The modeling process examined group differences adjusted for age, gender, stage, and time of LCSS assessment. LCSS scores were transformed onto a scale of 0 to 100 points in which higher LCSS scores corresponded to a lower QOL. A 10-point difference between groups was defined a priori as being clinically significant. RESULTS: At the time of lung cancer diagnosis, 18% of the patients were never-smokers, 58% were former smokers, and 24% were current smokers. Among survey respondents completing the LCSS at follow-up assessment (1,028 respondents), the mean age was 65.2 years (SD, 10.8 years) and 45% were women. Thirty percent of baseline current smokers continued to smoke at the time of the follow-up assessment (ie, persistent smokers). The adjusted mean total LCSS scores for never-smokers and persistent smokers were 17.6 (SD, 4.02) and 28.7 (SD, 5.09), respectively (p < 0.0001). Seven of the individual LCSS QOL components (ie, appetite, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, lung cancer symptoms, illness affecting normal activities, and overall QOL) were clinically and statistically (p < 0.001) different between never-smokers and persistent smokers. No clinically significant differences were noted for pain or hemoptysis. Former smokers had intermediate LCSS scores. No dose-response trends were observed between the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day or the total number of pack-years smoked and the adjusted scores. CONCLUSION: The hypothesized relationship between smoking status and QOL was supported by this correlational study. Our findings suggest that persistent cigarette smoking after a lung cancer diagnosis negatively impacts QOL scores.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Placing patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the prone position has been shown to improve survival as compared to the supine position. However, a higher frequency of pressure ulcers has been reported in patients in the prone position. The objective of this study was to verify the impact of prone positioning on pressure ulcers in patients with severe ARDS. METHODS: This was an ancillary study of a prospective multicentre randomised controlled trial in patients with severe ARDS in which the early application of long prone-positioning sessions was compared to supine positioning in terms of mortality. Pressure ulcers were assessed at the time of randomisation, 7 days later and on discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), using the four-stage Pressure Ulcers Advisory Panel system. The primary end-point was the incidence (with reference to 1,000 days of invasive mechanical ventilation or 1,000 days of ICU stay) of new patients with pressure ulcers at stage 2 or higher from randomisation to ICU discharge. RESULTS: At randomisation, of the 229 patients allocated to the supine position and the 237 patients allocated to the prone position, the number of patients with pressure ulcers was not significantly different between groups. The incidence of new patients with pressure ulcers from randomisation to ICU discharge was 20.80 and 14.26/1,000 days of invasive mechanical ventilation (P = 0.061) and 13.92 and 7.72/1,000 of ICU days (P = 0.002) in the prone and supine groups, respectively. Position group [odds ratio (OR) 1.5408, P = 0.0653], age >60 years (OR 1.5340, P = 0.0019), female gender (OR 0.5075, P = 0.019), body mass index of >28.4 kg/m2 (OR 1.9804, P = 0.0037), and a Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at inclusion of >46 (OR 1.2765, P = 0.3158) were the covariates independently associated to the acquisition of pressure ulcers. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe ARDS, prone positioning was associated with a higher frequency of pressure ulcers than the supine position. Prone positioning improves survival in patients with severe ARDS and, therefore, survivors who received this intervention had a greater likelihood of having pressure ulcers documented as part of their follow-up. There are risk groups for the development of pressure ulcers in severe ARDS, and these patients need surveillance and active prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Approaches to removal of sedation and mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients vary widely. Our aim was to assess a protocol that paired spontaneous awakening trials (SATs)-ie, daily interruption of sedatives-with spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). METHODS: In four tertiary-care hospitals, we randomly assigned 336 mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care to management with a daily SAT followed by an SBT (intervention group; n=168) or with sedation per usual care plus a daily SBT (control group; n=168). The primary endpoint was time breathing without assistance. Data were analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00097630. FINDINGS: One patient in the intervention group did not begin their assigned treatment protocol because of withdrawal of consent and thus was excluded from analyses and lost to follow-up. Seven patients in the control group discontinued their assigned protocol, and two of these patients were lost to follow-up. Patients in the intervention group spent more days breathing without assistance during the 28-day study period than did those in the control group (14.7 days vs 11.6 days; mean difference 3.1 days, 95% CI 0.7 to 5.6; p=0.02) and were discharged from intensive care (median time in intensive care 9.1 days vs 12.9 days; p=0.01) and the hospital earlier (median time in the hospital 14.9 days vs 19.2 days; p=0.04). More patients in the intervention group self-extubated than in the control group (16 patients vs six patients; 6.0% difference, 95% CI 0.6% to 11.8%; p=0.03), but the number of patients who required reintubation after self-extubation was similar (five patients vs three patients; 1.2% difference, 95% CI -5.2% to 2.5%; p=0.47), as were total reintubation rates (13.8%vs 12.5%; 1.3% difference, 95% CI -8.6% to 6.1%; p=0.73). At any instant during the year after enrolment, patients in the intervention group were less likely to die than were patients in the control group (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92; p=0.01). For every seven patients treated with the intervention, one life was saved (number needed to treat was 7.4, 95% CI 4.2 to 35.5). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that a wake up and breathe protocol that pairs daily spontaneous awakening trials (ie, interruption of sedatives) with daily spontaneous breathing trials results in better outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care than current standard approaches and should become routine practice.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Previous trials involving patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have failed to show a beneficial effect of prone positioning during mechanical ventilatory support on outcomes. We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death and severe disability by 2 months. MAIN RESULTS: For the 596 patients studied (median age, 67 years; 52% female), the primary cause of coma was cardiac arrest in 31% and cerebral infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage in 36%. At 2 months 69% had died, 20% had survived with known severe disability, 8% were known to have survived without severe disability, and 3% survived with unknown functional status. Five clinical variables available on day 3 after enrollment were associated independently with 2-month mortality: abnormal brain stem response (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 8.1), absent verbal response (OR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.8 to 11.7), absent withdrawal response to pain (OR = 4.3; 95% CI, 1.7 to 10.8), creatinine level greater than or equal to 132.6 mumol/L (1.5 mg/dL) (OR = 4.5; 95% CI, 1.8 to 11.0), and age of 70 years or older (OR = 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2 to 12.2). Mortality at 2 months for patients with four or five of these risk factors was 97% (58/60; 95% CI, 88% to 100%) in the validation set. Brain stem and motor responses best predicted death or severe disability by 2 months. For patients with either an abnormal brain stem response or absent motor response to pain, the rate of death or severe disability at 2 months was 96% (185/193; 95% CI, 92% to 98%) in the validation set. CONCLUSIONS: Five readily available clinical variables identify a large subgroup of patients in nontraumatic coma at high risk for poor outcomes. This risk stratification approach offers physicians, patients, and patients' families information that may prove useful in patient care decisions and resource allocation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The recognition of patient deterioration depends largely on identifying abnormal vital signs, yet little is known about the daily pattern of vital signs measurement and charting. METHODS: We compared the pattern of vital signs and VitalPAC Early Warning Score (ViEWS) data collected from admissions to all adult inpatient areas (except high care areas, such as critical care units) of a NHS district general hospital from 1 May 2010 to 30 April 2011, to the hospital's clinical escalation protocol. Main outcome measures were hourly and daily patterns of vital signs and ViEWS value documentation; numbers of vital signs in the periods 08:00-11:59 and 20:00-23:59 with subsequent vital signs recorded in the following 6 h; and time to next observation (TTNO) for vital signs recorded in the periods 08:00-11:59 and 20:00-23:59. RESULTS: 950 043 vital sign datasets were recorded. The daily pattern of observation documentation was not uniform; there were large morning and evening peaks, and lower night-time documentation. The pattern was identical on all days. 23.84% of vital sign datasets with ViEWS >/= 9 were measured at night compared with 10.12-19.97% for other ViEWS values. 47.42% of patients with ViEWS=7-8 and 31.22% of those with ViEWS >/= 9 in the period 20:00-23:59 did not have vital signs recorded in the following 6 h. TTNO decreased with increasing ViEWS value, but less than expected by the monitoring protocol. CONCLUSIONS: There was only partial adherence to the vital signs monitoring protocol. Sicker patients appear more likely to have vital signs measured overnight, but even their observations were often not followed by timely repeat assessments. The observed pattern of monitoring may reflect the impact of competing clinical priorities.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: To determine whether a restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion and a liberal strategy produced equivalent results in critically ill patients, we compared the rates of death from all causes at 30 days and the severity of organ dysfunction. METHODS: We enrolled 838 critically ill patients with euvolemia after initial treatment who had hemoglobin concentrations of less than 9.0 g per deciliter within 72 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and randomly assigned 418 patients to a restrictive strategy of transfusion, in which red cells were transfused if the hemoglobin concentration dropped below 7.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter, and 420 patients to a liberal strategy, in which transfusions were given when the hemoglobin concentration fell below 10.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter. RESULTS: Overall, 30-day mortality was similar in the two groups (18.7 percent vs. 23.3 percent, P= 0.11). However, the rates were significantly lower with the restrictive transfusion strategy among patients who were less acutely ill -- those with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of < or =20 (8.7 percent in the restrictive-strategy group and 16.1 percent in the liberal-strategy group; P=0.03) -- and among patients who were less than 55 years of age (5.7 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively; P=0.02), but not among patients with clinically significant cardiac disease (20.5 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively; P=0.69). The mortality rate during hospitalization was significantly lower in the restrictive-strategy group (22.3 percent vs. 28.1 percent, P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion is at least as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy in critically ill patients, with the possible exception of patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the degree of interinstitutional transfusion practice variation and reasons why red cells are administered in critically ill patients. STUDY DESIGN: Multicentre cohort study combined with a cross-sectional survey of physicians requesting red cell transfusions for patients in the cohort. STUDY POPULATION: The cohort included 5298 consecutive patients admitted to six tertiary level intensive care units in addition to administering a survey to 223 physicians requesting red cell transfusions in these units. MEASUREMENTS: Haemoglobin concentrations were collected, along with the number and reasons for red cell transfusions plus demographic, diagnostic, disease severity (APACHE II score), intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and lengths of stay in the ICU. RESULTS: Twenty five per cent of the critically ill patients in the cohort study received red cell transfusions. The overall number of transfusions per patient-day in the ICU averaged 0.95 +/- 1.39 and ranged from 0.82 +/- 1.69 to 1.08 +/- 1.27 between institutions (P < 0.001). Independent predictors of transfusion thresholds (pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentrations) included patient age, admission APACHE II score and the institution (P < 0.0001). A very significant institution effect (P < 0.0001) persisted even after multivariate adjustments for age, APACHE II score and within four diagnostic categories (cardiovascular disease, respiratory failure, major surgery and trauma) (P < 0.0001). The evaluation of transfusion practice using the bedside survey documented that 35% (202 of 576) of pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentrations were in the range of 95-105 g/l and 80% of the orders were for two packed cell units. The most frequent reasons for administering red cells were acute bleeding (35%) and the augmentation of O2 delivery (25%). CONCLUSIONS: There is significant institutional variation in critical care transfusion practice, many intensivists adhering to a 100g/l threshold, and opting to administer multiple units despite published guidelines to the contrary. There is a need for prospective studies to define optimal practice in the critically ill.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Early detection of acute lung injury (ALI) is essential for timely implementation of evidence-based therapies and enrollment into clinical trials. We aimed to determine the accuracy of computerized syndrome surveillance for detection of ALI in hospitalized patients and compare it with routine clinical assessment. DESIGN: Using a near-real time copy of the electronic medical records, we developed and validated a custom ALI electronic alert (ALI "sniffer") based on the European-American Consensus Conference Definition and compared its performance against provider-derived documentation. PATIENTS AND SETTING: A total of 3,795 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to nine multidisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care teaching institution were included. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ALI developed in 325 patients and was recognized by bedside clinicians in only 86 (26.5%). Under-recognition of ALI was associated with not implementing protective mechanical ventilation (median tidal volumes of 9.2 vs. 8.0 ml/kg predicted body weight, P < 0.001). ALI "sniffer" demonstrated excellent sensitivity of 96% (95% CI 94-98) and moderate specificity of 89% (95% CI 88-90) with a positive predictive value ranging from 24% (95% CI 13-40) in the heart-lung transplant ICU to 64% (95% CI 55-71) in the medical ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The computerized surveillance system accurately identifies critically ill patients who develop ALI syndrome. Since the lack of ALI recognition is a barrier to the timely implementation of best practices and enrollment into research studies, computerized syndrome surveillance could be a useful tool to enhance patient safety and clinical research.},

This study describes changes in the amount of critical care provided in U.S. EDs between 2001 and 2009. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 2001-2009. SETTING: National multistage probability sample of U.S. ED data. U.S. ED capacity was estimated using the National Emergency Department Inventory-United States. PATIENTS: : ED patients admitted a critical care unit. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: Annual hours of ED-based critical care and annual number critical care ED visits. Clinical characteristics, demographics, insurance status, setting, geographic region, and ED length of stay for critically ill ED patients. MAIN RESULTS: Annual critical care unit admissions from U.S. EDs increased by 79% from 1.2 to 2.2 million. The proportion of all ED visits resulting in critical care unit admission increased from 0.9% to 1.6% (ptrend < 0.001). Between 2001 and 2009, the median ED length of stay for critically ill patients increased from 185 to 245 minutes (+ 60 min; ptrend < 0.02). For the aggregated years 2001-2009, ED length of stay for critical care visits was longer among black patients (12.6% longer) and Hispanic patients (14.8% longer) than among white patients, and one third of all critical care ED visits had an ED length of stay greater than 6 hrs. Between 2001 and 2009, total annual hours of critical care at U.S. EDs increased by 217% from 3.2 to 10.1 million (ptrend < 0.001). The average daily amount of critical care provided in U.S. EDs tripled from 1.8 to 5.6 hours per ED per day. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of critical care provided in U.S. EDs has increased substantially over the past decade, driven by increasing numbers of critical care ED visits and lengthening ED length of stay. Increased critical care burden will further stress an already overcapacity U.S. emergency care system.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Patients with cardiac arrests or who die in general wards have often received delayed or inadequate care. We investigated whether the medical emergency team (MET) system could reduce the incidence of cardiac arrests, unplanned admissions to intensive care units (ICU), and deaths. METHODS: We randomised 23 hospitals in Australia to continue functioning as usual (n=11) or to introduce a MET system (n=12). The primary outcome was the composite of cardiac arrest, unexpected death, or unplanned ICU admission during the 6-month study period after MET activation. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Introduction of the MET increased the overall calling incidence for an emergency team (3.1 vs 8.7 per 1000 admissions, p=0.0001). The MET was called to 30% of patients who fulfilled the calling criteria and who were subsequently admitted to the ICU. During the study, we recorded similar incidence of the composite primary outcome in the control and MET hospitals (5.86 vs 5.31 per 1000 admissions, p=0.640), as well as of the individual secondary outcomes (cardiac arrests, 1.64 vs 1.31, p=0.736; unplanned ICU admissions, 4.68 vs 4.19, p=0.599; and unexpected deaths, 1.18 vs 1.06, p=0.752). A reduction in the rate of cardiac arrests (p=0.003) and unexpected deaths (p=0.01) was seen from baseline to the study period for both groups combined. INTERPRETATION: The MET system greatly increases emergency team calling, but does not substantially affect the incidence of cardiac arrest, unplanned ICU admissions, or unexpected death.},

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective follow-up study of all patients admitted to intensive care in three acute-care hospitals. PATIENTS: The study population totalled 551 patients admitted to intensive care: 90 from the general ward, 239 from operating rooms (OR) and 222 from the Emergency Department (ED). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients from the general wards had greater severity of illness (APACHE II median 21) than those from the OR (15) or ED (19). A greater percentage of patients from the general wards (47.6%) died than from OR (19.3%) and ED (31.5%). Patients from the general wards had a greater number of serious antecedents before admission to intensive care 43 (72%) than those from OR 150 (64.4%) or ED 126 (61.8%). Of the 551 patients 62 had antecedents during the period 8-48 h before admission to intensive care, and 53 had antecedents both within 8 and 48 h before their admission. The most common antecedents during the 8 h before admission were hypotension (n=199), tachycardia (n=73), tachypnoea (n=64), and sudden change in level of consciousness (n=42). Concern was expressed in the clinical notes by attending staff in 70% of patients admitted from the general wards. CONCLUSIONS: In over 60% of patients admitted to intensive care potentially life-threatening abnormalities were documented during the 8 h before their admission. This may represent a patient population who could benefit from improved resuscitation and care at an earlier stage.},

  Abstract                 = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has a high mortality and is associated with significant morbidity. Prior outcome studies have focused predominant on short-term outcomes (6-12 months). We assessed longitudinal neurocognitive, emotional, and quality of life in ARDS survivors at hospital discharge, and 1 and 2 years after hospital discharge using neuropsychologic tests and emotional and quality-of-life questionnaires. Neurocognitive sequelae occurred in 73% (54 of 74) of ARDS survivors at hospital discharge, 46% (30 of 66) at 1 year, and 47% (29 of 62) at 2 years. ARDS survivors report moderate to severe depression (16% and 23%) and anxiety (24% and 23%) at 1 and 2 years, respectively. The ARDS survivors had decreased quality of life, with the physical domains improving at 1 year, with no additional change at 2 years. Role emotional, pain, and general health did not change from hospital discharge to 2 years. Mental health improved during the first year and declined at 2 years. ARDS results in significant neurocognitive and emotional morbidity and decreased quality of life that persists at least 2 years after hospital discharge. ARDS can cause significant long-term, brain-related morbidity manifest by neurocognitive impairments and decreased quality of life.},

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. SETTING: A university-affiliated medical-surgical-trauma intensive care unit over a 1-yr period. PATIENTS: One hundred randomly selected critically ill patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the best practices studied, there was great variability in the proportion of patients eligible (median 36.5%, range 10% to 100%) and the proportion without contraindication (32.5%, range 10% to 86%) for each practice. The median rate of prescription of best practices for eligible patients was 56.5%, with a range from 8% to 95%. There was greater prescription of best practices when standard admission orders included an option to prescribe them (p = .048). Among those practices with standard admission orders, there was greatest prescription for practices additionally having a specialty consultation service (p = .004). There was an inverse association between severity of illness and prescription of best practices (p = .001): Sicker patients were less likely to be prescribed best practices. CONCLUSIONS: There may be substantial variability in the acceptance and prescription of commonly recommended best practices for critically ill patients. Standard order sets and focused specialty consultation may improve knowledge translation and prescription of best practice.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Almost half of the patients with septic shock develop acute lung injury (ALI). The understanding why some patients do and others do not develop ALI is limited. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that delayed treatment of septic shock is associated with the development of ALI. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit in a tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Prospectively identified patients with septic shock who did not have ALI at the outset, excluding those who denied research authorization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High frequency cardio-respiratory monitoring, arterial gas analysis, and portable chest radiographs were reviewed to identify the timing of ALI development. Risk factors present before ALI development were identified by review of electronic medical records and analyzed in univariate and multivariate analyses. Seventy-one of 160 patients (44%) developed ALI at a median of 5 (range 2-94) hours after the onset of septic shock. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following predictors of ALI development: delayed goal-directed resuscitation (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52-8.63, p = .004), delayed antibiotics (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.06 -5.59, p = .039), transfusion (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.22-6.37, p = .016), alcohol abuse (OR 2.09, 95% CI .88-5.10, p = 0.098), recent chemotherapy (OR 6.47, 95% CI 1.99-24.9, p = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (OR .44, 95% CI .17-1.07, p = .076), and baseline respiratory rate (OR 2.03 per sd, 95% CI 1.38-3.08, p &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: When adjusted for known modifiers of ALI expression, delayed treatment of shock and infection were associated with development of ALI.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Cognitive impairment and functional disability are major determinants of caregiving needs and societal health care costs. Although the incidence of severe sepsis is high and increasing, the magnitude of patients' long-term cognitive and functional limitations after sepsis is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the change in cognitive impairment and physical functioning among patients who survive severe sepsis, controlling for their presepsis functioning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A prospective cohort involving 1194 patients with 1520 hospitalizations for severe sepsis drawn from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of US residents (1998-2006). A total of 9223 respondents had a baseline cognitive and functional assessment and had linked Medicare claims; 516 survived severe sepsis and 4517 survived a nonsepsis hospitalization to at least 1 follow-up survey and are included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Personal interviews were conducted with respondents or proxies using validated surveys to assess the presence of cognitive impairment and to determine the number of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) for which patients needed assistance. RESULTS: Survivors' mean age at hospitalization was 76.9 years. The prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment increased 10.6 percentage points among patients who survived severe sepsis, an odds ratio (OR) of 3.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-7.25) in multivariable regression. Likewise, a high rate of new functional limitations was seen following sepsis: in those with no limits before sepsis, a mean 1.57 new limitations (95% CI, 0.99-2.15); and for those with mild to moderate limitations before sepsis, a mean of 1.50 new limitations (95% CI, 0.87-2.12). In contrast, nonsepsis general hospitalizations were associated with no change in moderate to severe cognitive impairment (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.80-1.67; P for difference vs sepsis = .01) and with the development of fewer new limitations (mean among those with no limits before hospitalization, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39-0.57; P for difference vs sepsis <.001 and mean among those with mild to moderate limits, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.63; P for difference = .001). The declines in cognitive and physical function persisted for at least 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Severe sepsis in this older population was independently associated with substantial and persistent new cognitive impairment and functional disability among survivors. The magnitude of these new deficits was large, likely resulting in a pivotal downturn in patients' ability to live independently.},

  Abstract                 = {AIM OF STUDY: To build an early warning score (EWS) based exclusively on routinely undertaken laboratory tests that might provide early discrimination of in-hospital death and could be easily implemented on paper. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a database of combined haematology and biochemistry results for 86,472 discharged adult patients for whom the admission specialty was Medicine, we used decision tree (DT) analysis to generate a laboratory decision tree early warning score (LDT-EWS) for each gender. LDT-EWS was developed for a single set (n=3496) (Q1) and validated in 22 other discrete sets each of three months long (Q2, Q3...Q23) (total n=82,976; range of n=3428 to 4093) by testing its ability to discriminate in-hospital death using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. RESULTS: The data generated slightly different models for male and female patients. The ranges of AUROC values (95% CI) for LDT-EWS with in-hospital death as the outcome for the validation sets Q2-Q23 were: 0.755 (0.727-0.783) (Q16) to 0.801 (0.776-0.826) [all patients combined, n=82,976]; 0.744 (0.704-0.784, Q16) to 0.824 (0.792-0.856, Q2) [39,591 males]; and 0.742 (0.707-0.777, Q10) to 0.826 (0.796-0.856, Q12) [43,385 females]. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the results of commonly measured laboratory tests collected soon after hospital admission can be represented in a simple, paper-based EWS (LDT-EWS) to discriminate in-hospital mortality. We hypothesise that, with appropriate modification, it might be possible to extend the use of LDT-EWS throughout the patient's hospital stay.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rapidly progressing and fatal disease for which liver transplantation (LT) is the only treatment. Posttransplant mechanical ventilation tends to be more prolonged in patients with ALF than in other LT patients. The present study examined the clinical effects of prolonged posttransplant mechanical ventilation (PMV), and identified risk factors for PMV following LT for ALF. METHODS: We reviewed data of patients undergoing LT for ALF between January 2005 and June 2011. After grouping patients according to administration of PMV (>/= 24 h), donor and recipient perioperative variables were compared between the groups with and without PMV. Potentially significant factors (P < 0.1) from the univariate intergroup comparison were entered into a multivariate logistic regression to establish a predictive model for PMV. RESULTS: Twenty-four (25.3%) of 95 patients with ALF who received PMV had a higher mortality rate (29.2% vs 11.3%, P = 0.038) and longer intensive care unit stay (12.9 +/- 10.4 vs 7.1 +/- 2.7 days, P = 0.012) than patients without PMV. The intergroup comparisons revealed worse preoperative hepatic conditions, more supportive therapy, and more intraoperative fluctuations in vital signs and less urine output in the with- compared with the without-PMV group. The multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative hepatic encephalopathy (>/= grade III), intraoperative blood pressure fluctuation, and oliguria (< 0.5 ml/kg/h) were independent risk factors for PMV. CONCLUSIONS: PMV was associated with deleterious outcomes. Besides care for known risk factors including hepatic encephalopathy, meticulous attention to managing intraoperative hemodynamic circulatory status is required to avoid PMV and improve the posttransplant prognosis in ALF patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Acute axonal polyneuropathy has been found in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. This 'critical illness polyneuropathy' (CIP) has been associated with difficult weaning from the ventilator in retrospective studies. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that CIP is related to the degree and number of organ dysfunctions, and to weaning problems. DESIGN: Prospective study of 18 months. SETTING: A multidisciplinary intensive care unit in a general hospital SUBJECTS: Thirty-eight patients under 75 years of age who had been mechanically ventilated for more than 7 days, without previous signs of or risk factors for polyneuropathy. MEASURES: Organ dysfunctions were quantified using a dynamic scoring system (0-12 points). Electromyography studies were performed during mechanical ventilation to identify patients with and without CIP. RESULTS: CIP was present in 18 out of 38 patients and associated with an increased organ dysfunction score (5.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.5; p = 0.003) and number of organs involved [median (range): 4 (3-5) vs. 2 (1-4); p = 0.009], in particular cardiovascular (p = 0.003), renal (p = 0.04), and hematopoietic failure (p = 0.04). Patients with polyneuropathy were ventilated longer, but this was not clearly due to more difficult weaning [median: 16.5 (1-48) vs. 9.5 (1-38) days; p = 0.26]. Polyneuropathy was present in 2 of 4 patients with normal weaning. CONCLUSIONS: Axonal polyneuropathy is related to the severity of multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome. Its presence does not necessarily implicate difficult weaning from artificial ventilation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The combination of complete diaphragm inactivity and mechanical ventilation (for more than 18 hours) elicits disuse atrophy of myofibers in animals. We hypothesized that the same may also occur in the human diaphragm. METHODS: We obtained biopsy specimens from the costal diaphragms of 14 brain-dead organ donors before organ harvest (case subjects) and compared them with intraoperative biopsy specimens from the diaphragms of 8 patients who were undergoing surgery for either benign lesions or localized lung cancer (control subjects). Case subjects had diaphragmatic inactivity and underwent mechanical ventilation for 18 to 69 hours; among control subjects diaphragmatic inactivity and mechanical ventilation were limited to 2 to 3 hours. We carried out histologic, biochemical, and gene-expression studies on these specimens. RESULTS: As compared with diaphragm-biopsy specimens from controls, specimens from case subjects showed decreased cross-sectional areas of slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers of 57% (P=0.001) and 53% (P=0.01), respectively, decreased glutathione concentration of 23% (P=0.01), increased active caspase-3 expression of 100% (P=0.05), a 200% higher ratio of atrogin-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to MBD4 (a housekeeping gene) (P=0.002), and a 590% higher ratio of MuRF-1 mRNA transcripts to MBD4 (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 18 to 69 hours of complete diaphragmatic inactivity and mechanical ventilation results in marked atrophy of human diaphragm myofibers. These findings are consistent with increased diaphragmatic proteolysis during inactivity.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Mortality from severe sepsis and septic shock differs across continents, countries, and regions. We aimed to use data from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) to compare models of care and outcomes for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the USA and Europe. METHODS: The SSC was introduced into more than 200 sites in Europe and the USA. All patients identified with severe sepsis and septic shock in emergency departments or hospital wards and admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and those with sepsis in ICUs were entered into the SSC database. Patients entered into the database from its launch in January, 2005, through January, 2010, in units with at least 20 patients and 3 months of enrolment of patients were included in this analysis. Patients included in the cohort were limited to those entered in the first 4 years at every site. We used random-effects logistic regression to estimate the hospital mortality odds ratio (OR) for Europe relative to the USA. We used random-effects linear regression to find the relation between lengths of stay in hospital and ICU and geographic region. FINDINGS: 25 375 patients were included in the cohort. The USA included 107 sites with 18 766 (74%) patients, and Europe included 79 hospital sites with 6609 (26%) patients. In the USA, 12 218 (65.1%) were admitted to the ICU from the emergency department whereas in Europe, 3405 (51.5%) were admitted from the wards. The median stay on the hospital wards before ICU admission was longer in Europe than in the USA (1.0 vs 0.1 days, difference 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-0.9). Raw hospital mortality was higher in Europe than in the USA (41.1%vs 28.3%, difference 12.8, 95% CI 11.5-14.7). The median length of stay in ICU (7.8 vs 4.2 days, 3.6, 3.3-3.7) and hospital (22.8 vs 10.5 days, 12.3, 11.9-12.8) was longer in Europe than in the USA. Adjusted mortality in Europe was not significantly higher than that in the USA (32.3%vs 31.3%, 1.0, -1.7 to 3.7, p=0.468). Complete compliance with all applicable elements of the sepsis resuscitation bundle was higher in the USA than in Europe (21.6%vs 18.4%, 3.2, 2.2-4.4). INTERPRETATION: The significant difference in unadjusted mortality and the fact that this difference disappears with severity adjustment raise important questions about the effect of the approach to critical care in Europe compared with that in the USA. The effect of ICU bed availability on outcomes in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock requires further investigation.},

A performance improvement initiative targeted changing clinical behavior (process improvement) via bundles based on key SSC guideline recommendations on process improvement and patient outcomes. DESIGN AND SETTING: A multifaceted intervention to facilitate compliance with selected guideline recommendations in the ICU, ED, and wards of individual hospitals and regional hospital networks was implemented voluntarily in the US, Europe, and South America. Elements of the guidelines were "bundled" into two sets of targets to be completed within 6 h and within 24 h. An analysis was conducted on data submitted from January 2005 through March 2008. MAIN RESULTS: Data from 15,022 subjects at 165 sites were analyzed to determine the compliance with bundle targets and association with hospital mortality. Compliance with the entire resuscitation bundle increased linearly from 10.9% in the first site quarter to 31.3% by the end of 2 years (P<0.0001). Compliance with the entire management bundle started at 18.4% in the first quarter and increased to 36.1% by the end of 2 years (P = 0.008). Compliance with all bundle elements increased significantly, except for inspiratory plateau pressure, which was high at baseline. Unadjusted hospital mortality decreased from 37 to 30.8% over 2 years (P = 0.001). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality improved the longer a site was in the Campaign, resulting in an adjusted absolute drop of 0.8% per quarter and 5.4% over 2 years (95% CI, 2.5-8.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The Campaign was associated with sustained, continuous quality improvement in sepsis care. Although not necessarily cause and effect, a reduction in reported hospital mortality rates was associated with participation. The implications of this study may serve as an impetus for similar improvement efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the transferability of primary care quality indicators by comparing indicators for common clinical problems developed using the same method in the UK and the USA. METHOD: Quality indicators developed in the USA for a range of common conditions using the RAND-UCLA appropriateness method were applied to 19 common primary care conditions in the UK. The US indicators for the selected conditions were used as a starting point, but the literature reviews were updated and panels of UK primary care practitioners were convened to develop quality indicators applicable to British general practice. RESULTS: Of 174 indicators covering 18 conditions in the US set for which a direct comparison could be made, 98 (56.3%) had indicators in the UK set which were exactly or nearly equivalent. Some of the differences may have related to differences in the process of developing the indicators, but many appeared to relate to differences in clinical practice or norms of professional behaviour in the two countries. There was a small but non-significant relationship between the strength of evidence for an indicator and the probability of it appearing in both sets of indicators. CONCLUSION: There are considerable benefits in using work from other settings in developing measures of quality of care. However, indicators cannot simply be transferred directly between countries without an intermediate process to allow for variation in professional culture or clinical practice.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents a substantial health care burden, and there is limited epidemiologic information about the demography of sepsis or about the temporal changes in its incidence and outcome. We investigated the epidemiology of sepsis in the United States, with specific examination of race and sex, causative organisms, the disposition of patients, and the incidence and outcome. METHODS: We analyzed the occurrence of sepsis from 1979 through 2000 using a nationally representative sample of all nonfederal acute care hospitals in the United States. Data on new cases were obtained from hospital discharge records coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. RESULTS: Review of discharge data on approximately 750 million hospitalizations in the United States over the 22-year period identified 10,319,418 cases of sepsis. Sepsis was more common among men than among women (mean annual relative risk, 1.28 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.24 to 1.32]) and among nonwhite persons than among white persons (mean annual relative risk, 1.90 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.81 to 2.00]). Between 1979 and 2000, there was an annualized increase in the incidence of sepsis of 8.7 percent, from about 164,000 cases (82.7 per 100,000 population) to nearly 660,000 cases (240.4 per 100,000 population). The rate of sepsis due to fungal organisms increased by 207 percent, with gram-positive bacteria becoming the predominant pathogens after 1987. The total in-hospital mortality rate fell from 27.8 percent during the period from 1979 through 1984 to 17.9 percent during the period from 1995 through 2000, yet the total number of deaths continued to increase. Mortality was highest among black men. Organ failure contributed cumulatively to mortality, with temporal improvements in survival among patients with fewer than three failing organs. The average length of the hospital stay decreased, and the rate of discharge to nonacute care medical facilities increased. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of sepsis and the number of sepsis-related deaths are increasing, although the overall mortality rate among patients with sepsis is declining. There are also disparities among races and between men and women in the incidence of sepsis. Gram-positive bacteria and fungal organisms are increasingly common causes of sepsis.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We have little systematic information about the extent to which standard processes involved in health care--a key element of quality--are delivered in the United States. METHODS: We telephoned a random sample of adults living in 12 metropolitan areas in the United States and asked them about selected health care experiences. We also received written consent to copy their medical records for the most recent two-year period and used this information to evaluate performance on 439 indicators of quality of care for 30 acute and chronic conditions as well as preventive care. We then constructed aggregate scores. RESULTS: Participants received 54.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 54.3 to 55.5) of recommended care. We found little difference among the proportion of recommended preventive care provided (54.9 percent), the proportion of recommended acute care provided (53.5 percent), and the proportion of recommended care provided for chronic conditions (56.1 percent). Among different medical functions, adherence to the processes involved in care ranged from 52.2 percent for screening to 58.5 percent for follow-up care. Quality varied substantially according to the particular medical condition, ranging from 78.7 percent of recommended care (95 percent confidence interval, 73.3 to 84.2) for senile cataract to 10.5 percent of recommended care (95 percent confidence interval, 6.8 to 14.6) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The deficits we have identified in adherence to recommended processes for basic care pose serious threats to the health of the American public. Strategies to reduce these deficits in care are warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Consumers, purchasers, and regulators are seeking information on quality for a variety of purposes. To address these demands, methods are required that are flexible in meeting the information needs of different audiences. OBJECTIVES: To test a new clinically detailed, comprehensive approach to quality measurement called Quality Assessment (QA) Tools. DESIGN: Quality measures were developed for women ages 18 to 50 years for preventive care and 17 clinical areas that included chronic and acute health problems. A stratified random sample of women enrolled in 1 of 2 health plans in 1996 to 1997 was drawn and data abstracted from the medical records of all their providers for a 2-year period. FINDINGS: We evaluated quality for 758 women in 2 managed care plans. Quality of care varied substantially depending on the dimension being examined. For example, acute care was significantly better than chronic or preventive care. Quality was highest for follow-up care and lowest for treatment in both plans. Quality by modality ranged from approximately 90% for referral or admission to 16% for education and counseling. We found significant differences between the plans in the quality of care for 7 of the 17 conditions studied. CONCLUSION: The QA Tools system offers an alternative approach to evaluating health system performance. Potential advantages include the richness of the information produced by the system, the ability to create summary scores for consumers and purchasers, and the system-level performance information for use in quality improvement activities.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: For critical care to be effective it must have a system in place to achieve optimal care for the deteriorating ward patient. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the available literature to assess whether either early warning systems or emergency response teams improve hospital survival. In the event of there being a lack of evidence regarding hospital survival, secondary outcome measures were considered (unplanned ICU admissions, ICU mortality, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, cardiac arrest rates). METHODS: The Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane library and NHS databases were searched in September 2012 along with non-catalogued resources for papers examining the effect of early warning systems or emergency response teams on hospital survival. Inclusion criteria were original clinical trials and comparative studies in adult inpatients that assessed either an early warning system or emergency response team against any of the predefined outcome measures. Exclusion criteria were previous systematic reviews, non-English abstracts and studies incorporating paediatric data. Studies were arranged in to sections focusing on the following interventions: In each section an appraisal of the level of evidence and a recommendation has been made using the SIGN grading system. RESULTS: 43 studies meeting the review criteria were identified and included for analysis. 2 studies assessed single parameter scoring systems and 4 addressed aggregate weighted scoring systems. A total of 20 studies examined medical emergency teams and 22 studies examined multidisciplinary outreach teams. LIMITATIONS: The exclusion of non English studies and those including paediatric patients does limit the applicability of this review. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the available evidence is of poor quality. It is clear that a 'whole system' approach should be adopted and that AWSS appear to be more effective than single parameter systems. The response to deterioration appears most effective when a clinician with critical care skills leads it. The need for service improvement differs between health care systems.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence, nature, causes, and consequences of suboptimal care before admission to intensive care units, and to suggest possible solutions. DESIGN: Prospective confidential inquiry on the basis of structured interviews and questionnaires. SETTING: A large district general hospital and a teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: A cohort of 100 consecutive adult emergency admissions, 50 in each centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Opinions of two external assessors on quality of care especially recognition, investigation, monitoring, and management of abnormalities of airway, breathing, and circulation, and oxygen therapy and monitoring. RESULTS: Assessors agreed that 20 patients were well managed (group 1) and 54 patients received suboptimal care (group 2). Assessors disagreed on quality of management of 26 patients (group 3). The casemix and severity of illness, defined by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score, were similar between centres and the three groups. In groups 1, 2, and 3 intensive care mortalities were 5 (25%), 26 (48%), and 6 (23%) respectively (P=0.04) (group 1 versus group 2, P=0.07). Hospital mortalities were 7 (35%), 30 (56%), and 8 (31%) (P=0.07) and standardised hospital mortality ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.23 (0.49 to 2.54), 1.4 (0.94 to 2.0), and 1.26 (0.54 to 2.48) respectively. Admission to intensive care was considered late in 37 (69%) patients in group 2. Overall, a minimum of 4.5% and a maximum of 41% of admissions were considered potentially avoidable. Suboptimal care contributed to morbidity or mortality in most instances. The main causes of suboptimal care were failure of organisation, lack of knowledge, failure to appreciate clinical urgency, lack of supervision, and failure to seek advice. CONCLUSIONS: The management of airway, breathing, and circulation, and oxygen therapy and monitoring in severely ill patients before admission to intensive care units may frequently be suboptimal. Major consequences may include increased morbidity and mortality and requirement for intensive care.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: We explored the use of routine blood tests and national early warning scores (NEWS) reported within +/-24 hours of admission to predict in-hospital mortality in emergency admissions, using empirical decision Tree models because they are intuitive and may ultimately be used to support clinical decision making. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective analysis of adult emergency admissions to a large acute hospital during April 2009 to March 2010 in the West Midlands, England, with a full set of index blood tests results (albumin, creatinine, haemoglobin, potassium, sodium, urea, white cell count and an index NEWS undertaken within +/-24 hours of admission). We developed a Tree model by randomly splitting the admissions into a training (50%) and validation dataset (50%) and assessed its accuracy using the concordance (c-) statistic. Emergency admissions (about 30%) did not have a full set of index blood tests and/or NEWS and so were not included in our analysis. RESULTS: There were 23248 emergency admissions with a full set of blood tests and NEWS with an in-hospital mortality of 5.69%. The Tree model identified age, NEWS, albumin, sodium, white cell count and urea as significant (p<0.001) predictors of death, which described 17 homogeneous subgroups of admissions with mortality ranging from 0.2% to 60%. The c-statistic for the training model was 0.864 (95%CI 0.852 to 0.87) and when applied to the testing data set this was 0.853 (95%CI 0.840 to 0.866). CONCLUSIONS: An easy to interpret validated risk adjustment Tree model using blood test and NEWS taken within +/-24 hours of admission provides good discrimination and offers a novel approach to risk adjustment which may potentially support clinical decision making. Given the nature of the clinical data, the results are likely to be generalisable but further research is required to investigate this promising approach.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most common intensive care unit-acquired infection. Although there is widespread consensus that evidenced-based interventions reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, controversy has surrounded the importance of implementing them as a "bundle" of care. This study aimed to determine the effects of implementing such a bundle while controlling for potential confounding variables seen in similar studies. DESIGN: A before-and-after study conducted within the context of an existing, independent, infection surveillance program. SETTING: An 18-bed, mixed medical-surgical teaching hospital intensive care unit. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to intensive care for 48 hrs or more during the periods before and after intervention. INTERVENTIONS: A four-element ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundle, consisting of head-of-bed elevation, oral chlorhexidine gel, sedation holds, and a weaning protocol implemented as part of the Scottish Patient Safety Program using Institute of Health Care Improvement methods. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compliance with head-of-bed elevation and chlorhexidine gel were 95%-100%; documented compliance with "wake and wean" elements was 70%, giving overall bundle compliance rates of 70%. Compared to the preintervention period, there was a significant reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia in the postintervention period (32 cases per 1,000 ventilator days to 12 cases per 1,000 ventilator days; p<.001). Statistical process control charts showed the decrease was most marked after bundle implementation. Patient cohorts staying >/=6 and >/=14 days had greater reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia acquisition and also had reduced antibiotic use (reduced by 1 and 3 days; p=.008/.007, respectively). Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisition also decreased (10% to 3.6%; p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention bundle was associated with a statistically significant reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia, which had not been achieved with earlier ad hoc ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention guidelines in our unit. This occurred despite an inability to meet bundle compliance targets of 95% for all elements. Our data support the systematic approach to achieving high rates of process compliance and suggest systematic introduction can decrease both infection incidence and antibiotic use, especially for patients requiring longer duration of ventilation.},

Maternal PPD is a well-known condition and has been extensively researched. In comparison, PPD in fathers and its potential effects on the family are not widely recognized. Studies have shown the importance of optimal mental health in fathers during the postpartum period. Negative effects of paternal PPD affect marital/partner relationships, infant bonding, and child development. To promote optimal health for parents and children, pediatric nurse practitioners must stay up to date on this topic.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To review the use of screening criteria (also known as "triggers") as a mechanism for engaging palliative care consultants to assist with care of critically ill patients and their families in the ICU. DATA SOURCES: We searched the MEDLINE database from inception to December 2012 for all English-language articles using the terms "trigger," "screen," "referral," "tool," "triage," "case-finding," "assessment," "checklist," "proactive," or "consultation," together with "intensive care" or "critical care" and "palliative care," "supportive care," "end-of-life care," or "ethics." We also hand-searched reference lists and author files and relevant tools on the Center to Advance Palliative Care website. STUDY SELECTION: Two members (a physician and a nurse with expertise in clinical research, intensive care, and palliative care) of the interdisciplinary Improving Palliative Care in the ICU Project Advisory Board presented studies and tools to the full Board, which made final selections by consensus. DATA EXTRACTION: We critically reviewed the existing data and tools to identify screening criteria for palliative care consultation, to describe methods for selecting, implementing, and evaluating such criteria, and to consider alternative strategies for increasing access of ICU patients and families to high-quality palliative care. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Improving Palliative Care in the ICU Advisory Board used data and experience to address key questions relating to: existing screening criteria; optimal methods for selection, implementation, and evaluation of such criteria; and appropriateness of the screening approach for a particular ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Use of specific criteria to prompt proactive referral for palliative care consultation seems to help reduce utilization of ICU resources without changing mortality, while increasing involvement of palliative care specialists for critically ill patients and families in need. Existing data and resources can be used in developing such criteria, which should be tailored for a specific ICU, implemented through an organized process involving key stakeholders, and evaluated by appropriate measures. In some settings, other strategies for increasing access to palliative care may be more appropriate.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Severe sepsis is a common cause for admission to the general medical ward. Previous work has demonstrated substantial new long-term disability in patients with severe sepsis, but the short-term functional outcomes of patients admitted to the general medical floor -- where the majority of severe sepsis is treated -- are largely unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients initially admitted to non-ICU medical wards at a tertiary care academic medical center. Severe sepsis was confirmed by three physician reviewers, using the International Consensus Conference definition of sepsis. Baseline functional status, disposition location, and receipt of post-acute skilled care were recorded using a structured abstraction instrument. RESULTS: 3,146 discharges had severe sepsis by coding algorithm; from a random sample of 111 patients, 64 had the diagnosis of severe sepsis confirmed by reviewers. The mean age of the 64 patients was 63.5 years +/- 18.0. Prior to admission, 80% of patients lived at home and 50.8% of patients were functionally independent. Inpatient mortality was 12.5% and 37.5% of patients were discharged to a nursing facility. Of all patients in the cohort, 50.0% were discharged home, and 66.7% of patients who were functionally independent at baseline were discharged to home. CONCLUSIONS: New physical debility is a common feature of severe sepsis in patients initially cared for on the general medical floor. Debility occurs even in those with good baseline physical function. Interventions to improve the poor functional outcomes of this population are urgently needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of acute myocardial infarction, trauma, and stroke have been translated into improved outcomes by earlier diagnosis and application of therapy at the most proximal stage of hospital presentation. Most therapies for these diseases are instituted prior to admission to an ICU; this approach to the sepsis patient has been lacking. In response, a trial comparing early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) vs standard care was performed using specific criteria for the early identification of high-risk sepsis patients, verified definitions, and a consensus-derived protocol to reverse the hemodynamic perturbations of hypovolemia, vasoregulation, myocardial suppression, and increased metabolic demands. Five years after the EGDT publication, there has been much discussion generated with regard to the concepts of EGDT, as well as debate fueled regarding diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. However, during this time period further investigations by the primary investigators and others have brought additional contemporary findings. EGDT modulates some of the components of inflammation, as reflected by improved organ function. The end points used in the EGDT protocol, the outcome results, and the cost-effectiveness have subsequently been externally validated, revealing similar or even better findings than those from the original trial. Although EGDT is faced with challenges, a coordinated approach to sepsis management is necessary to duplicate the progress in outcomes seen in patients with conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and trauma.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and decrease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model. RESULTS: The hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7% (95% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3% (95% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P=0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness.

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to assess whether repeated derecruitments induced by the repetitive withdrawal of high positive end-expiratory pressure could induce lung injury in a swine model. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, experimental animal study. SETTING: University laboratory. SUBJECTS: Specific pathogen-free pigs (Choong-Ang Laboratory Animals, Seoul, Korea) weighing around 30 kg. INTERVENTIONS: After lung injury was induced by repeated saline lavage, pigs were ventilated in pressure-limited mode with the highest possible positive end-expiratory pressure with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg and maximum inspiratory pressure of 30 cm H2O. With this initial ventilator setting, the control group (n = 5) received ventilation without derecruitments for 4 hours, and in the derecruitment group (n = 5), derecruitments were repeatedly induced by intentional disconnection of the ventilatory circuit for 30 seconds every 5 minutes for 4 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After the initial increase in positive end-expiratory pressure, the PaO2 increased to greater than 450 mm Hg in both groups. The PaO2 remained at greater than 450 mm Hg in the control group persistently, but in the derecruitment group, PaO2 significantly decreased to 427.7 mm Hg (adjusted p = 0.03) after 2 hours and remained significant for the rest of the study. PaCO2, oxygenation index, and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient also significantly increased after 2 hours compared with the control group. However, the variables of respiratory mechanics except for minute volume at 2-hour point showed no difference between the two groups for the duration of the study. Histologically, significant bronchiolar injury was observed in the dependent portion of the derecruitment group compared with the controls (p = 0.03), but not in the nondependent area of the lung. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated derecruitments exacerbated lung injury, particularly at the bronchiolar level in the dependent portion. Strategies to minimize this type of injury should be incorporated when designing optimal ventilator strategies in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been 10 years since the last publication of the clinical practice guidelines for pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium (PAD). The results of new studies have directed significant changes in critical care practice. Using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the guidelines were revised, resulting in 32 recommendations and 22 summary statements. This article provides guidance toward guideline implementation strategies and outlines 10 key points to consider. Compared with its predecessor, the 2013 PAD guidelines are less prescriptive in that they recommend approaches to patient care rather than giving specific medication recommendations. This will help focus care teams on the process and structure of patient management and result in more flexibility when choosing specific medications. This article outlines approaches to guideline implementation that take into account the changes in philosophy surrounding medication selection. The manuscript focuses on the areas anticipated to generate the most change such as lighter sedation targets, avoidance of benzodiazepines, and early mobility. A gap analysis grid is provided. The release of any guideline should prompt reevaluation of current institutional practice standards. This manuscript uses the PAD guidelines as an example of how to approach the interprofessional work of guideline implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Pain, dyspnea, and thirst are three of the most prevalent, intense, and distressing symptoms of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In this report, the interdisciplinary Advisory Board of the Improving Palliative Care in the ICU (IPAL-ICU) Project brings together expertise in both critical care and palliative care along with current information to address challenges in assessment and management. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of literature focusing on intensive care and palliative care research related to palliation of pain, dyspnea, and thirst. RESULTS: Evidence-based methods to assess pain are the enlarged 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for ICU patients able to self-report and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool or Behavior Pain Scale for patients who cannot report symptoms verbally or non-verbally. The Respiratory Distress Observation Scale is the only known behavioral scale for assessment of dyspnea, and thirst is evaluated by patient self-report using an 0-10 NRS. Opioids remain the mainstay for pain management, and all available intravenous opioids, when titrated to similar pain intensity end points, are equally effective. Dyspnea is treated (with or without invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation) by optimizing the underlying etiological condition, patient positioning and, sometimes, supplemental oxygen. Several oral interventions are recommended to alleviate thirst. Systematized improvement efforts addressing symptom management and assessment can be implemented in ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: Relief of symptom distress is a key component of critical care for all ICU patients, regardless of condition or prognosis. Evidence-based approaches for assessment and treatment together with well-designed work systems can help ensure comfort and related favorable outcomes for the critically ill.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a major deficiency in the end-of-life care offered to patients dying in the intensive care unit (ICU). HYPOTHESIS: Hospitalized dying patients had informed discussions on end-of-life and palliative care options before admission to ICU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive non-interventional study was performed at a teaching hospital to examine if patients who died in hospital had informed discussions on end-of-life care before admission to ICU. The impact of these discussions on subsequent patient care: aggressive therapy in the ICU, the quality of palliation, use of hospice care services and utilization of hospital resources were examined. Data were collected from medical records for all hospital deaths over 24 months. RESULTS: Of 252 hospital deaths, 196 (78%) were treated and subsequently 165 (65%) died in the ICU. Patients treated either in the ICU or general hospital wards had similar frequency of ultimately or rapidly fatal pre-existing disease (47% versus 62%, P: ns) and readmission to hospital within one year before death (43% versus 57%, P, ns). The median age (10-90% percentile) was slightly younger for the ICU than hospital wards patients: 73 (45-85) versus 76 (55-91) years, P < 0.01. Of the 156 patients who were transferred to ICU from hospital wards: 136 (87%) were managed by house staff on teaching services and 20 (13%) were managed by attending staff hospitalists, P < 0.01. None of those transferred to the ICU who subsequently died had discussion of palliation or end-of-life care as an alternative treatment. Of those who died who were treated on general wards, 14 (25%) patients had discussion of palliation as an alternative treatment option before death. Do-not-resuscitate decisions were made in 48% of cases two days before death. Patients who were treated in the ICU had more invasive tests performed on them and were less likely to have adequate pain control or referral to hospice care services than on a general ward. Median hospital charge was much higher for patients who received ICU versus general ward care (33,252 dollars versus 8549 dollars, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who died in the ICU did not have informed discussions of end-of-life or palliative care as an alternative treatment option before admission. The quality of end-of-life care was disrupted for patients with fatal pre-existing chronic disease who were admitted to the ICU before death. Lack of clinical experience, knowledge and competency with end-of-life care influenced admission of patients to ICU regardless of poor prognosis. Decisions regarding the pursuit of aggressive therapy versus palliative care must be addressed with patients by physicians who are competent and experienced in end-of-life care as this will have a profound impact on both the quality of care delivered and effective use of limited hospital resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Implementation of care bundles for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and its impact on patient outcomes requires validation with long-term follow-up. A collaborative multi-centre cohort study was conducted in five Spanish adult intensive-care units. A care bundle approach based on five measures was implemented after a 3-month baseline period, and compliance, VAP rates, intensive-care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) and duration of mechanical ventilation were prospectively recorded for 16 months. There were 149 patients in the baseline period and 885 after the intervention. Compliance with all measures after intervention was <30% (264/885). In spite of this, VAP incidence decreased from 15.5% (23/149) to 11.7% (104/885), after the intervention (p <0.05). This reduction was significantly associated with hand hygiene (OR = 0.35), intra-cuff pressure control (OR = 0.21), oral hygiene (OR = 0.23) and sedation control (OR = 0.51). Use of the care bundle was associated with an incidence risk ratio of VAP of 0.78 (95% CI 0.15-0.99). We documented a reduction of median ICU LOS (from 10 to 6 days) and duration of mechanical ventilation (from 8 to 4 days) for patients with full bundle compliance (intervention period). Efforts on VAP prevention and outcome improvement should focus on achieving higher compliance in hand and oral hygiene, sedation protocols and intracuff pressure control.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Goal-directed therapy has been used for severe sepsis and septic shock in the intensive care unit. This approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. Clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. In-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups. RESULTS: Of the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were randomly assigned to early goal-directed therapy and 133 to standard therapy; there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to base-line characteristics. In-hospital mortality was 30.5 percent in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5 percent in the group assigned to standard therapy (P = 0.009). During the interval from 7 to 72 hours, the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy had a significantly higher mean (+/-SD) central venous oxygen saturation (70.4+/-10.7 percent vs. 65.3+/-11.4 percent), a lower lactate concentration (3.0+/-4.4 vs. 3.9+/-4.4 mmol per liter), a lower base deficit (2.0+/-6.6 vs. 5.1+/-6.7 mmol per liter), and a higher pH (7.40+/-0.12 vs. 7.36+/-0.12) than the patients assigned to standard therapy (P < or = 0.02 for all comparisons). During the same period, mean APACHE II scores were significantly lower, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in the patients assigned to early goal-directed therapy than in those assigned to standard therapy (13.0+/-6.3 vs. 15.9+/-6.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early goal-directed therapy provides significant benefits with respect to outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Severe sepsis is a common, costly, and complex problem, the epidemiology of which has only been well studied in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, nearly half of all patients with severe sepsis are cared for outside the ICU. OBJECTIVE: To determine rates of infection and organ system dysfunction in patients with severe sepsis admitted to non-ICU services. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A large, tertiary, academic medical center in the United States. PATIENTS: Adult patients initially admitted to non-ICU medical services from 2009 through 2010. MEASUREMENTS: All International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes were screened for severe sepsis. Three hospitalists reviewed a sample of medical records evaluating the characteristics of severe sepsis. RESULTS: Of 23,288 hospitalizations, 14% screened positive for severe sepsis. A sample of 111 cases was manually reviewed, identifying 64 cases of severe sepsis. The mean age of patients with severe sepsis was 63 years, and 39% were immunosuppressed prior to presentation. The most common site of infection was the urinary tract (41%). The most common organ system dysfunctions were cardiovascular (hypotension) and renal dysfunction occurring in 66% and 64% of patients, respectively. An increase in the number of organ systems affected was associated with an increase in mortality and eventual ICU utilization. Severe sepsis was documented by the treating clinicians in 47% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Severe sepsis was commonly found and poorly documented on the wards at our medical center. The epidemiology and organ dysfunctions among patients with severe sepsis appear to be different from previously described ICU severe sepsis populations.},

In a prospective study, we followed up for 1 year 30 of the original 34 patients who had undergone cardiac surgery with CPB. Patients were assessed preoperatively, before discharge, and at 1 year after surgery with the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and a series of neuropsychological tests. Psychometric scales were administered to evaluate cognitive functioning (Syndrom Kurztest), depressive symptomatology (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), posttraumatic stress symptoms (Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome 10-Questions Inventory) and HRQOL (SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire). Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) was used daily over the course of intensive care unit treatment. Postoperative delirium developed in 11 of the 34 patients (mean DRS rating scale score+/-S.D.: 20.36+/-6.22, range: 14-31). Short-term consequences of cardiac surgery included adjustment disorder with depressed features (n=11), posttraumatic stress disorder (n=6), major depression (n=6) and clinically relevant cognitive deficits (n=13). At 12 months, the severity of depression and anxiety disorders improved and returned to the preoperative level, and 6 out of the 30 followed-up patients displayed cognitive deficits. Our patients' HRQOL SF-36 self-reports significantly improved compared with baseline quality of life data. However, 1-year overall lower cognitive function scores were associated with lower HRQOL. Cardiac surgery with CPB is associated with improvements in HRQOL relative to the preoperative period, but the presence of cardiac surgery-related cognitive decline impairing HRQOL is a complication for a subgroup of cardiac surgical patients in the long-term outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Lung-protective mechanical ventilation with the use of lower tidal volumes has been found to improve outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It has been suggested that use of lower tidal volumes also benefits patients who do not have ARDS. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of lower tidal volumes is associated with improved outcomes of patients receiving ventilation who do not have ARDS. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to August 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies evaluated use of lower vs higher tidal volumes in patients without ARDS at onset of mechanical ventilation and reported lung injury development, overall mortality, pulmonary infection, atelectasis, and biochemical alterations. DATA EXTRACTION: Three reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods, and outcomes. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty articles (2822 participants) were included. Meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model showed a decrease in lung injury development (risk ratio [RR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.47; I2, 0%; number needed to treat [NNT], 11), and mortality (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; I2, 0%; NNT, 23) in patients receiving ventilation with lower tidal volumes. The results of lung injury development were similar when stratified by the type of study (randomized vs nonrandomized) and were significant only in randomized trials for pulmonary infection and only in nonrandomized trials for mortality. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model showed, in protective ventilation groups, a lower incidence of pulmonary infection (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.92; I2, 32%; NNT, 26), lower mean (SD) hospital length of stay (6.91 [2.36] vs 8.87 [2.93] days, respectively; standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.82; I2, 75%), higher mean (SD) PaCO2 levels (41.05 [3.79] vs 37.90 [4.19] mm Hg, respectively; SMD, -0.51; 95% CI, -0.70 to -0.32; I2, 54%), and lower mean (SD) pH values (7.37 [0.03] vs 7.40 [0.04], respectively; SMD, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.31 to 2.02; I2, 96%) but similar mean (SD) ratios of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen (304.40 [65.7] vs 312.97 [68.13], respectively; SMD, 0.11; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.27; I2, 60%). Tidal volume gradients between the 2 groups did not influence significantly the final results. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients without ARDS, protective ventilation with lower tidal volumes was associated with better clinical outcomes. Some of the limitations of the meta-analysis were the mixed setting of mechanical ventilation (intensive care unit or operating room) and the duration of mechanical ventilation.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a major public health problem. Social factors may affect health behaviors, economic resources, and immune response, leading to hospitalization for infection. This study examines the association between marital status and sepsis incidence and outcomes in a population-based cohort. METHODS: We analyzed 1,113,581 hospitalizations in New Jersey in 2006. We estimated risk-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for sepsis among divorced, widowed, legally separated, single, and married subjects using population data from the American Community Survey. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate marital status-specific hospital mortality. RESULTS: We identified 37,524 hospitalizations for sepsis, of which 40% were among married (14,924), 7% were among divorced (2,548), 26% were among widowed (9,934), 2% (763) were among legally separated, and 26% (9355) were among single subjects. The incidence of hospitalization for sepsis was 5.8 per 1,000 population. The age, sex, and race-adjusted IRR for hospitalization with sepsis was greatest for single (IRR = 3.47; 95% CI, 3.1, 3.9), widowed (IRR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.2, 1.6), and legally separated (IRR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.2, 1.8) subjects compared with married (referent). We observed that single men and women and divorced men had greater odds of in-hospital mortality compared with married men; widowed and legally separated men and all ever-married women had no excess mortality during hospitalization for sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for sepsis is more common among single, widowed, and legally separated individuals, independent of other demographic factors. Among patients hospitalized for sepsis, single and divorced men and single women experience greater hospital mortality, highlighting the need to characterize the potentially modifiable mechanisms linking marital status to its greater burden of critical illness.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Most people exposed to M. tuberculosis show no evidence of clinical disease. Five to 10% of individuals with latent infection progress to develop overt disease during their life time. Identification of people with latent TB infection will increase case detection rates and may dictate new treatment policies to control tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine LTBI point prevalence in a population from Sudan using two different diagnostic methods: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the IFN-gamma release assay (IGRA). METHODS: This was a prospective, community-based and case-controlled study. Following informed consent, household contacts (HHCs; n = 98) of smear-positive index cases and Community controls (CCs; 186), were enrolled. Tuberculin skin test (TST), whole blood stimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 +/- TB7.7 antigens or purified protein derivative (PPD) and IFN-gamma levels determination with ELISA were performed. The levels of IFN-gamma and TST induration between the CCs and the HHCs were compared using student t-test, Chi-square and Kappa coefficient. Pearson correlation test was used to compare TST and IFN-gamma. P levels of <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: TST induration of >= 10 mm gave an LTBI point prevalence of 327 cases/1000 individuals among HHCs compared to 126 cases/1000 individuals among CCs (p = 0.000). PPD-induced IFN-gamma release assay gave an LTBI point prevalence of 418 cases/1000 individuals among HHCs compared to 301 cases/1000 individuals among CCs (p =0.06). On the other hand ESAT-6/CFP-10 +/- TB7.7-induced IFN-gamma gave an LTBI point prevalence of 429 cases/1000 individuals among HHCs compared to 268 cases/1000 individuals among CCs (p = 0.01). IFN-gamma productions levels induced by ESAT-6/CPF-10 +/- TB7.7 antigens in HHCS and CCs were not significantly different from those induced by PPD (p = 0.7). CONCLUSION: IFN-gamma release assay (IGRA) gave higher LTBI point prevalence compared to TST in HHCs and CCs. PPD gave comparable results to ESAT-6/CFP-10 +/- TB7.7 antigens in whole blood IFN-gamma release, making it a cheap alternative to the recombinant antigens.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors for prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation after open heart surgery in Pakistan. DESIGN: This study is based on retrospective analysis of database. PLACE AND DURATION: We conducted study of all patients who underwent open heart surgery at CPE Institute of Cardiology, Multan from March 2009 to May 2011. PATIENTS & METHODS: The data was retrieved from the database in the form of electronic spreadsheet which was then analyzed using SPSS software. The patients with incomplete data entries were removed from the analysis resulting in a set of 1,617 patients. The data of each patient consisted of 65 preoperative, operative and postoperative variables. The data was summarized as means, medians and standard deviations for numeric variables and frequencies and percentages or categoric variables. These risk factors were compared using Chi-sqaure test. Their ODDs ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ODD's Ratios and P values were calculated. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1,617 patients, 77 patients (4.76%) had prolonged ventilation for a cumulated duration of more than over 24 hours. Preoperative renal failure, emphysema, low EF (<30%), urgent operation, preoperative critical state, prolonged bypass time, prolonged cross clamp time, complex surgical procedures and peri-operative myocardial infarction were found to be risk factors for PIMV. Old age, female gender, advanced ASA class, advanced NYHA class, diabetes mellitus, smoking, history of COPD, redo surgery, left main stenosis, obesity and use of intra-aortic balloon pump were not found to have significant ODDs ratios for PIMV. The patients with prolonged ventilation had significantly high mortality i.e. 32.47% while the normal ventilation group had 0.32% overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the previously considered risk factors for prolonged ventilation after open heart study are no more significant risk factors. However, prolonged ventilation continues to be associated with very high mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Quality of life (QOL) end points in pharmaceutical clinical trials are at a crossroads. On the one hand, much has been learned in recent years of how to efficiently and effectively measure patient QOL. On the other hand, investigators and regulatory agencies still struggle with exactly how to assess the results of QOL end points and other patient-reported outcomes. Statisticians are often left in the position of having to bridge the gap between investigators who want to assess patient QOL and regulatory bodies who want a sound scientific rationale and analysis plan for doing so. Unfortunately, little has been written specifically for the statistical audience to assist in this translation. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to bridge this gap. We will describe the language and methods that have been successful in translating the psychometric and statistical challenges into understandable findings for investigators and regulatory agencies. One of the most important advances is the development of a general guideline for assessing clinical significance, namely the "half standard deviation" method based on the empirical rule effect size (ERES) approach. We populate the paper with concrete examples of how QOL data need not be treated any different, in terms of statistical analysis, than tumor response or other clinical end points.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: Early warning scores (EWS) are recommended as part of the early recognition and response to patient deterioration. The Royal College of Physicians recommends the use of a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) for the routine clinical assessment of all adult patients. METHODS: We tested the ability of NEWS to discriminate patients at risk of cardiac arrest, unanticipated intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death within 24h of a NEWS value and compared its performance to that of 33 other EWSs currently in use, using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and a large vital signs database (n=198,755 observation sets) collected from 35,585 consecutive, completed acute medical admissions. RESULTS: The AUROCs (95% CI) for NEWS for cardiac arrest, unanticipated ICU admission, death, and any of the outcomes, all within 24h, were 0.722 (0.685-0.759), 0.857 (0.847-0.868), 0.894 (0.887-0.902), and 0.873 (0.866-0.879), respectively. Similarly, the ranges of AUROCs (95% CI) for the other 33 EWSs were 0.611 (0.568-0.654) to 0.710 (0.675-0.745) (cardiac arrest); 0.570 (0.553-0.568) to 0.827 (0.814-0.840) (unanticipated ICU admission); 0.813 (0.802-0.824) to 0.858 (0.849-0.867) (death); and 0.736 (0.727-0.745) to 0.834 (0.826-0.842) (any outcome). CONCLUSIONS: NEWS has a greater ability to discriminate patients at risk of the combined outcome of cardiac arrest, unanticipated ICU admission or death within 24h of a NEWS value than 33 other EWSs.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: There is no up-to-date literature review of physiologically-based, single-parameter weighted "track and trigger" systems (SPTTS) and little data on their sensitivity and specificity to predict adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to describe the SPTTS in clinical use and measure their sensitivity and specificity when using admission vital signs data for predicting in-hospital mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature to describe the SPTTS, their components and their differences. We measured their sensitivity and specificity for predicting in-hospital mortality when using a database of 9987 admission vital signs datasets. RESULTS: We identified 39 unique classes of SPTTS, of which 30 were evaluated. There was considerable variation in the physiological variables used, together with significant variation in the physiological values used to trigger a medical emergency or critical care outreach team. There was marked variation in sensitivity (7.3-52.8%), specificity (69.1-98.1%), positive predictive values (13.5-26.1%), negative predictive values (92.1-94.2%) and the potential number of calls triggered (234-3271). CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range of unique, but very similar, SPTTS in clinical use. Although specificities were high, sensitivities were too low to provide institutions with confidence that these SPTTS could identify patients at risk of in-hospital death using admission vital signs. Institutions may wish to consider these data when selecting which, if any, single-parameter track and trigger systems to introduce.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE:: Several studies have questioned the effectiveness of rapid-response systems when measured by outcomes such as decreased overall hospital mortality or cardiac arrest rates. We studied an alternative outcome of rapid-response system implementation, namely, its effect on goals of care and designation of do not resuscitate. DESIGN:: Retrospective chart review. SETTING:: Veterans Administration Hospital in New York City. SUBJECTS:: All patients requiring a medical emergency team call. INTERVENTIONS:: None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Monthly hospital census and discharge data, death occurrences, and do-not-resuscitate order placements were collected over an 8-year pre-medical emergency team and 5-year post-medical emergency team period. All medical emergency team calls and subsequent transfers to a critical care unit were reviewed and correlated to the placement and timing of do-not-resuscitate orders. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to evaluate the impact of the medical emergency team implementation on the change in trend of do-not-resuscitate orders and the hospital mortality. A total of 390 medical emergency team calls were associated with 109 do-not-resuscitate orders (28%). Of the 209 medical emergency team calls (54%) resulting in transfer to a critical care unit, 66 were associated with do-not-resuscitate orders, 73% of which were obtained after transfer. The odds of becoming do not resuscitate for a patient going to the ICU after the medical emergency team call were 2.9 (95% CI, 1.6-5.5; p = 0.001) times greater than for patients staying on the floors after the medical emergency team call. The medical emergency team implementation significantly changed the trend of do-not-resuscitate orders (p < 0.001) but had no impact on hospital mortality rate (p = 0.638). CONCLUSION:: Implementation of a rapid-response system was associated with an increase in do-not-resuscitate order placement. As a sentinel event, medical emergency team activation and transfer to a critical care unit foster consideration of goals of care and frequently results in a transition to a palliative care strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Severe sepsis is associated with high mortality and increased costs. The 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' (SSC) protocol was developed as an international initiative to reduce mortality. However, its cost-effectiveness is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the SSC protocol for the treatment of severe sepsis in Spain after the implementation of an educational program compared with the conventional care of severe sepsis. DESIGN: Observational prospective before-and-after study. SETTING: 59 medical-surgical intensive care units located throughout Spain. PATIENTS: A total of 854 patients were enrolled in the pre-educational program cohort (usual or standard care of severe sepsis) and 1,465 patients in the post-educational program cohort (SSC protocol care of severe sepsis). INTERVENTIONS: The educational program aimed to increase adherence to the SSC protocol. The SSC protocol included pharmacological and medical interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical (hospital mortality) and economic (health-care resource and treatment costs) outcomes were recorded. A health-care system perspective was used for costs. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Patients in the SSC protocol care cohort had a lower risk of hospital mortality (44.0% vs. 39.7%, P = 0.04). However, mean costs per patient were 1,736 euros higher in the SSC protocol care cohort (95% CI 114-3,358 euros), largely as a result of increased length of stay. Mean life years gained (LYG) were higher in the SSC protocol care cohort: 0.54 years (95% CI 0.02-1.05 years). The adjusted ICER of the SSC protocol was 4,435 euros per LYG. Nearly all (96.5%) the bootstrap replications were below the threshold of 30,000 euros per LYG. CONCLUSION: The SSC protocol seems to be a cost-effective option for treating severe sepsis in Spain.},

To determine whether changes upstream in the amyloidogenic pathway that forms Abeta plaques would improve cognitive outcomes, we administered tolfenamic acid for 34 days to hemizygous R1.40 transgenic mice. After the characterization of cognitive deficits in these mice, assessment of spatial learning and memory functions revealed that treatment with tolfenamic acid attenuated long-term memory and working memory deficits, determined using Morris water maze and the Y-maze. These improvements occurred within a shorter period of exposure than that seen with clinically approved drugs. Cognitive enhancement was accompanied by reduction in the levels of the SP1 protein (but not messenger RNA [mRNA]), followed by lowering both the mRNA and the protein levels of APP and subsequent Abeta levels. These findings provide evidence that tolfenamic acid can disrupt the pathologic processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are relevant to its scheduled biomarker study in AD patients.},

The objective of this study was to assess the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the physiological measurements, aggregate scores and triggering events of three such systems. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: General medical and surgical wards in one non-university acute hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Unselected ward patients: 114 patients in the inter-rater study and 45 patients in the intra-rater study were examined by four raters. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Physiological observations obtained at the bedside were evaluated using three systems: the medical emergency team call-out criteria (MET); the modified early warning score (MEWS); and the assessment score of sick-patient identification and step-up in treatment (ASSIST). Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients, kappa statistics and percentage agreement. There was fair to moderate agreement on most physiological parameters, and fair agreement on the scores, but better levels of agreement on triggers. Reliability was partially a function of simplicity: MET achieved a higher percentage of agreement than ASSIST, and ASSIST higher than MEWS. Intra-rater reliability was better then inter-rater reliability. Using corrected calculations improved the level of inter-rater agreement but not intra-rater agreement. CONCLUSION: There was significant variation in the reproducibility of different track-and-trigger warning systems. The systems examined showed better levels of agreement on triggers than on aggregate scores. Simpler systems had better reliability. Inter-rater agreement might improve by using electronic calculations of scores.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group included 650 patients with pathologically confirmed primary lung cancer whose conditions were diagnosed and/or treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2001. The QOL assessment was performed using the self-administered LCSS questionnaire (version 2) 6 months to 4 years after the diagnosis of lung cancer. RESULTS: The item response rate for all 9 LCSS questions was 94.2% with a minimum of 92.9%. Significant differences in overall QOL by sex (P=.04), Karnofsky scale (P<.001), weight loss (P<.001), disease stage (P<.001), and histology (P=.001) were found, but no significant differences in overall QOL by age (P=.17) or marital status (P=.06) were observed. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that QOL in patients with lung cancer at varying times after diagnosis highly correlates with baseline prognostic factors (disease stage, histology, Karnofsky scale, weight loss, and sex).},

  Abstract                 = {IMPORTANCE: A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report found that more persons die at home. This has been cited as evidence that persons dying in the United States are using more supportive care. OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in site of death, place of care, and health care transitions between 2000, 2005, and 2009. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective cohort study of a random 20% sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, aged 66 years and older, who died in 2000 (n = 270,202), 2005 (n = 291,819), or 2009 (n = 286,282). A multivariable regression model examined outcomes in 2000 and 2009 after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. Based on billing data, patients were classified as having a medical diagnosis of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or dementia in the last 180 days of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Site of death, place of care, rates of health care transitions, and potentially burdensome transitions (eg, health care transitions in the last 3 days of life). RESULTS: Our random 20% sample included 848,303 fee-for-service Medicare decedents (mean age, 82.3 years; 57.9% female, 88.1% white). Comparing 2000, 2005, and 2009, the proportion of deaths in acute care hospitals decreased from 32.6% (95% CI, 32.4%-32.8%) to 26.9% (95% CI, 26.7%-27.1%) to 24.6% (95% CI, 24.5%-24.8%), respectively. However, intensive care unit (ICU) use in the last month of life increased from 24.3% (95% CI, 24.1%-24.5%) to 26.3% (95% CI, 26.1%-26.5%) to 29.2% (95% CI, 29.0%-29.3%). (Test of trend P value was <.001 for each variable.) Hospice use at the time of death increased from 21.6% (95% CI, 21.4%-21.7%) to 32.3% (95% CI, 32.1%-32.5%) to 42.2% (95% CI, 42.0%-42.4%), with 28.4% (95% CI, 27.9%-28.5%) using a hospice for 3 days or less in 2009. Of these late hospice referrals, 40.3% (95% CI, 39.7%-40.8%) were preceded by hospitalization with an ICU stay. The mean number of health care transitions in the last 90 days of life increased from 2.1 (interquartile range [IQR], 0-3.0) to 2.8 (IQR, 1.0-4.0) to 3.1 per decedent (IQR, 1.0-5.0). The percentage of patients experiencing transitions in the last 3 days of life increased from 10.3% (95% CI, 10.1%-10.4%) to 12.4% (95% CI, 12.3%-2.5%) to 14.2% (95% CI, 14.0%-14.3%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Among Medicare beneficiaries who died in 2009 and 2005 compared with 2000, a lower proportion died in an acute care hospital, although both ICU use and the rate of health care transitions increased in the last month of life.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and cost. However, few and limited data are available on the prediction of duration of MV. We conducted an observational cohort study to seek predictive criteria. METHODS: The study was performed in a surgical ICU (SICU) in a university hospital. One hundred ninety-five consecutive unselected patients and 203 episodes of MV were prospectively analyzed to determine if clinical features, physiologic parameters, or multifactor scoring systems, at the time of admission or intubation, could be used as predictors of MV > or = 15 days. A univariate statistical analysis and a multiple logistic regression were used. A prospective validation study was then conducted to determine the accuracy of the results. RESULTS: (1) Univariate statistical analysis indicated that SICU length of stay, emergent endotracheal intubation as opposed to elective intubation, indication for MV, sepsis score at the time of admission and intubation, lung injury score (LIS) at the time of admission and intubation, number of organ system failures at the time of admission and intubation, and serum albumin concentration were significantly different between the two groups. (2) Only the circumstances (emergency) of endotracheal intubation (odds ratio [OR]=3.5, p=0.02) and the LIS (OR=3.7, p=0.004) independently predicted a duration of endotracheal intubation > or = 15 days. One hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients requiring emergent intubation and MV were included in the prospective validation. The accuracy of the LIS > or = 1 used to predict MV > or = 15 days was as follows: sensitivity=0.88; specificity=0.28; positive predictive value=0.24; negative predictive value=0.91. CONCLUSION: Low incidence of MV > or = 15 days was observed (13% and 20%, respectively, in observational cohort study and validation study) in unselected SICU patients. LIS > or = 1 at the time of intubation provides excellent negative predictive value (0.93 and 0.91) of duration of MV > or = 15 days. These data suggest that tracheotomy should not be considered for patients with LIS < 1.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Adverse events are unintended patient injuries or complications that arise from health care management resulting in death, disability or prolonged hospital stay. Adverse events that require critical care are a considerable financial burden to the health care system, but also their global impact on patients and society is probably underestimated. The objectives of this systematic review were to synthesize the best available evidence regarding the estimates of the incidence and preventability of adverse events that necessitate intensive care admission, to determine the type and consequences [mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and costs] of these adverse events. METHODS: MEDLINE (from 1966 to present), EMBASE (from 1974 to present) and CENTRAL (version 1-2010) were searched for studies reporting on unplanned admissions on ICUs. Several other sources were searched for additional studies. Only quantitative studies that used chart review for the detection of adverse events requiring intensive care admission were considered for eligibility. For the purposes of this systematic review, ICUs were defined as specialized hospital facilities which provide continuous monitoring and intensive care for acutely ill patients. Studies that were published in the English, Dutch, German, French or Spanish language were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were reviewed. Meta-analysis of the data was not appropriate because of methodological and statistical heterogeneity between studies; therefore, results are presented in a descriptive way. The percentage of surgical and medical adverse events that required ICU admission ranged from 1.1% to 37.2%. ICU readmissions varied from 0% to 18.3%. Preventability of the adverse events varied from 17% to 76.5%. Preventable adverse events are further synthesized by type of event. Consequences of the adverse events included a mean length of ICU stay that ranged from 1.5 days to 10.4 days for the patient's first stay in ICU and mortality percentages between 0% and 58%. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events are an important reason for (re)admission to the ICU and a considerable proportion of these are preventable. It was not possible to estimate an overall incidence and preventability rate of these events as we found considerable heterogeneity. To decrease adverse events that necessitate ICU admission, several systems are recommended such as early detection of patients with clinical instability on general wards and the implementation of rapid response teams. Step-down or intermediate care units could be a useful strategy for patients who require monitoring to avoid ICU readmissions. However, the effectiveness of such systems needs to be investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To compare the rates of perioperative morbidity of patients with sickle cell anemia who were randomly assigned to 2 preoperative transfusion regimens and to identify predisposing factors for perioperative complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Investigators at 36 centers enrolled 118 patients who were scheduled to have elective surgery and agreed to randomization between 2 preoperative transfusion regimens. Forty-seven subjects were enrolled but not randomized, including 20 who were not transfused before surgery. Perioperative management was based on a prescribed care plan. RESULTS: Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (TA) were performed on 136 persons, and 29 had myringotomy as their primary procedure. There were no differences in the frequency of complications between the randomized groups. The serious, non-transfusion complication rates for randomized patients were 32% (34 of 107) for TA and 36% (4 of 11) for myringotomy. A history of pulmonary disease was a predictor of postoperative sickle cell-related events for patients undergoing TA surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The more intensive transfusion regimen did not result in fewer perioperative complications. The high frequency of complications emphasizes the need for anticipatory management of persons undergoing TA. A history of pulmonary disease identifies patients at increased risk for sickle cell-related events after TA surgery. Patients undergoing myringotomy have a low frequency of sickle cell-related events but a significant frequency of other serious perioperative complications.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: In primary aldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling (AVS) suggests unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) when the aldosterone/cortisol (A/F) ratio is less than or equal to peripheral on one side and at least two times peripheral on the other. When A/F ratios are lower bilaterally than peripheral despite adequate samples (adrenal venous cortisol >/=3 times peripheral), we recommend repeat AVS. This study aimed to determine the frequency of this occurrence and outcomes in such cases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of all cases of primary aldosteronism undergoing initial AVS over a 34-year period. RESULTS: Initial AVS in 1397 patients returned satisfactory and discriminatory results in 1066 (76.3%) but 37 patients (2.6%) had adequate samples but bilateral A/F ratios no higher than peripheral. Of the 22 of these 37 who agreed to repeat AVS, 10 demonstrated unilateral aldosterone production, and eight of these had unilateral adrenalectomy disclosing APAs and resulting in cure (3) or improvement (5) in hypertension. Eight had bilateral aldosterone production. Four studies were inconclusive. Patients with initial unsatisfactory AVS because of bilaterally low A/F ratios had significantly (P=0.023) more unilateral disease [10 of 18 satisfactory repeat studies (55.6%) vs. 326 of 1066 satisfactory initial studies (30.6%)] and a significantly higher (67.6 vs. 49.9%, P=0.034) percentage of males. CONCLUSION: As the incidence of APAs was high in a subgroup with low A/F bilaterally on initial AVS, these patients should be offered repeat AVS. This might reflect both a greater dependence of aldosterone production on adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) in APAs and the pulsatile nature of ACTH secretion.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To determine whether the place of death for patients with cancer is associated with patients' quality of life (QoL) at the end of life (EOL) and psychiatric disorders in bereaved caregivers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal, multisite study of patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers (n = 342 dyads). Patients were followed from enrollment to death, a median of 4.5 months later. Patients' QoL at the EOL was assessed by caregiver report within 2 weeks of death. Bereaved caregivers' mental health was assessed at baseline and 6 months after loss with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and the Prolonged Grief Disorder interview. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, patients with cancer who died in an intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital experienced more physical and emotional distress and worse QoL at the EOL (all P </= .03), compared with patients who died at home with hospice. ICU deaths were associated with a heightened risk for posttraumatic stress disorder, compared with home hospice deaths (21.1% [four of 19] v 4.4% [six of 137]; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.00; 95% CI, 1.26 to 19.91; P = .02), after adjustment for caregivers' preexisting psychiatric illnesses. Similarly, hospital deaths were associated with a heightened risk for prolonged grief disorder (21.6% [eight of 37] v 5.2% [four of 77], AOR, 8.83; 95% CI, 1.51 to 51.77; P = .02), compared with home hospice deaths. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer who die in a hospital or ICU have worse QoL compared with those who die at home, and their bereaved caregivers are at increased risk for developing psychiatric illness. Interventions aimed at decreasing terminal hospitalizations or increasing hospice utilization may enhance patients' QoL at the EOL and minimize bereavement-related distress.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Talking about death can be difficult. Without evidence that end-of-life discussions improve patient outcomes, physicians must balance their desire to honor patient autonomy against a concern of inflicting psychological harm. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether end-of-life discussions with physicians are associated with fewer aggressive interventions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A US multisite, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n = 332 dyads), September 2002-February 2008. Patients were followed up from enrollment to death, a median of 4.4 months later. Bereaved caregivers' psychiatric illness and quality of life was assessed a median of 6.5 months later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aggressive medical care (eg, ventilation, resuscitation) and hospice in the final week of life. Secondary outcomes included patients' mental health and caregivers' bereavement adjustment. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three of 332 (37.0%) patients reported having end-of-life discussions before baseline. Such discussions were not associated with higher rates of major depressive disorder (8.3% vs 5.8%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-3.32), or more worry (mean McGill score, 6.5 vs 7.0; P = .19). After propensity-score weighted adjustment, end-of-life discussions were associated with lower rates of ventilation (1.6% vs 11.0%; adjusted OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.83), resuscitation (0.8% vs 6.7%; adjusted OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.80), ICU admission (4.1% vs 12.4%; adjusted OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.90), and earlier hospice enrollment (65.6% vs 44.5%; adjusted OR, 1.65;95% CI, 1.04-2.63). In adjusted analyses, more aggressive medical care was associated with worse patient quality of life (6.4 vs 4.6; F = 3.61, P = .01) and higher risk of major depressive disorder in bereaved caregivers (adjusted OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.12-10.13), whereas longer hospice stays were associated with better patient quality of life (mean score, 5.6 vs 6.9; F = 3.70, P = .01). Better patient quality of life was associated with better caregiver quality of life at follow-up (beta = .20; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life discussions are associated with less aggressive medical care near death and earlier hospice referrals. Aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse bereavement adjustment.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: Although hospital mortality has decreased over time in the United States for patients who receive intensive care, little is known about subsequent outcomes for those discharged alive. OBJECTIVE: To assess 3-year outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries who survive intensive care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A matched, retrospective cohort study was conducted using a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 years. A random half of all patients were selected who received intensive care and survived to hospital discharge in 2003 with 3-year follow-up through 2006. From the other half of the sample, 2 matched control groups were generated: hospitalized patients who survived to discharge (hospital controls) and the general population (general controls), individually matched on age, sex, race, and whether they had surgery (for hospital controls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Three-year mortality after hospital discharge. RESULTS: There were 35,308 intensive care unit (ICU) patients who survived to hospital discharge. The ICU survivors had a higher 3-year mortality (39.5%; n = 13,950) than hospital controls (34.5%; n = 12,173) (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.07 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.04-1.10]; P < .001) and general controls (14.9%; n = 5266) (AHR, 2.39 [95% CI, 2.31-2.48]; P < .001). The ICU survivors who did not receive mechanical ventilation had minimal increased risk compared with hospital controls (3-year mortality, 38.3% [n = 12,716] vs 34.6% [n=11,470], respectively; AHR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.07]). Those receiving mechanical ventilation had substantially increased mortality (57.6% [1234 ICU survivors] vs 32.8% [703 hospital controls]; AHR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.40-1.73]), with risk concentrated in the 6 months after the quarter of hospital discharge (6-month mortality, 30.1% (n = 645) for those receiving mechanical ventilation vs 9.6% (n = 206) for hospital controls; AHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.90-2.69]). Discharge to a skilled care facility for ICU survivors (33.0%; n = 11,634) and hospital controls (26.4%; n = 9328) also was associated with high 6-month mortality (24.1% for ICU survivors and hospital controls discharged to a skilled care facility vs 7.5% for ICU survivors and hospital controls discharged home; AHR, 2.62 [95% CI, 2.50-2.74]; P < .001 for ICU survivors and hospital controls combined). CONCLUSIONS: There is a large US population of elderly individuals who survived the ICU stay to hospital discharge but who have a high mortality over the subsequent years in excess of that seen in comparable controls. The risk is concentrated early after hospital discharge among those who require mechanical ventilation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Few contemporary population-based data exist about the incidence, patient characteristics, and outcomes of mechanical ventilation in acute care hospitals. We sought to describe the epidemiology of mechanical ventilation use in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using year 2005 hospital discharge records from six states. National projections were generated from age-, race-, and sex-specific rates in the cohort. SETTING: Nonfederal acute care hospitals. PATIENTS: All discharges that included invasive mechanical ventilation identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes (96.7x). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 6,469,674 hospitalizations in the six states, 180,326 (2.8%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. There was a wide age distribution with 52.2% of patients <65 yrs of age. A total of 44.6% had at least one major comorbid condition. The most common comorbidities included diabetes (13.2%) and pulmonary disease (13.2%). Inhospital mortality was 34.5%, and only 30.8% of patients were discharged home from the hospital. Almost all patients received care in urban (73.5%) or suburban (23.6%) hospitals vs. rural hospitals (2.9%). Patients in urban hospitals experienced a higher number of organ dysfunctions, more dialysis and tracheostomies, and higher mortality compared with patients in rural hospitals. Projecting to national estimates, there were 790,257 hospitalizations involving mechanical ventilation in 2005, representing 2.7 episodes of mechanical ventilation per 1000 population. Estimated national costs were $27 billion representing 12% of all hospital costs. Incidence, mortality, and cumulative population costs rose significantly with age. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation use is common and accounts for a disproportionate amount of resource use, particularly in urban hospitals and in elderly patients. Mortality for mechanically ventilated patients is high. Quality improvement and cost-reduction strategies targeted at these patients are warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of two quality improvement interventions (low tidal volume ventilation and restrictive transfusion) on the development of acute lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Three intensive care units in a tertiary academic center. PATIENTS: We included patients who were mechanically ventilated for > or =48 hrs excluding those who refused research authorization or had preexisting acute lung injury or pneumonectomy. INTERVENTIONS: Multifaceted interdisciplinary intervention consisting of Web-based teaching, respiratory therapy protocol, and decision support within computerized order entry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 375 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 212 were ventilated before and 163 after the interventions. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups except for a lower frequency of sepsis (27% vs. 17%, p = .030), trend toward lower median glucose level (140 mg/dL, interquartile range 118-168 vs. 132 mg/dL, interquartile range 113-156, p = .096), and lower frequency of pneumonia (27% vs. 20%, p = .130) during the second period. We observed a large decrease in tidal volume (10.6-7.7 mL/kg predicted body weight, p < .001), in peak airway pressure (31-25 cm H2O, p < .001), and in the percentage of transfused patients (63% to 38%, p < .001) after the intervention. The frequency of acute lung injury decreased from 28% to 10% (p < .001). The duration of mechanical ventilation decreased from a median of 5 (interquartile range 4-9) to 4 (interquartile range 4-8) days (p = .030). When adjusted for baseline characteristics in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, protocol intervention was associated with a reduction in the frequency of new acute lung injury (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Interdisciplinary intervention effectively decreased large tidal volumes and unnecessary transfusion in mechanically ventilated patients and was associated with a decreased frequency of new acute lung injury.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The primary outcomes were death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance and the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-11 vs. 10+/-11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2+/-0.8 and 11.8+/-0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25+/-6 and 33+/-8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.},

SETTING: Five teaching hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: A total of 9105 adults hospitalized with one or more of nine life-threatening diagnoses; an overall 6-month mortality rate of 47%. INTERVENTION: Physicians in the intervention group received estimates of the likelihood of 6-month survival for every day up to 6 months, outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and functional disability at 2 months. A specifically trained nurse had multiple contacts with the patient, family, physician, and hospital staff to elicit preferences, improve understanding of outcomes, encourage attention to pain control, and facilitate advance care planning and patient-physician communication. RESULTS: The phase I observation documented shortcomings in communication, frequency of aggressive treatment, and the characteristics of hospital death: only 47% of physicians knew when their patients preferred to avoid CPR: 46% of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were written within 2 days of death; 38% of patients who died spent at least 10 days in an intensive care unit (ICU); and for 50% of conscious patients who died in the hospital, family members reported moderate to severe pain at least half the time. During the phase II intervention, patients experienced no improvement in patient-physician communication (eg, 37% of control patients and 40% of intervention patients discussed CPR preferences) or in the five targeted outcomes, ie, incidence or timing of written DNR orders (adjusted ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.15), physicians' knowledge of their patients' preferences not to be resuscitated (adjusted ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.49), number of days spent in an ICU, receiving mechanical ventilation, or comatose before death (adjusted ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07), or level of reported pain (adjusted ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.33). The intervention also did not reduce use of hospital resources (adjusted ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.12). CONCLUSIONS: The phase I observation of SUPPORT confirmed substantial shortcomings in care for seriously ill hospitalized adults. The phase II intervention failed to improve care or patient outcomes. Enhancing opportunities for more patient-physician communication, although advocated as the major method for improving patient outcomes, may be inadequate to change established practices. To improve the experience of seriously ill and dying patients, greater individual and societal commitment and more proactive and forceful measured may be needed.},
