  Abstract                 = {Regional anaesthesia may reduce the rate of persistent (chronic) pain after surgery, a frequent and debilitating condition.To compare local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia for the prevention of persistent pain six or 12 months after surgery.We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), PubMed (1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (1966 to May 2012) and CINAHL (1966 to May 2012) without any language restriction. We used a combination of free text search and controlled vocabulary search. The results were limited to randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). We conducted a handsearch in reference lists of included trials, review articles and conference abstracts.We included RCTs comparing local anaesthetics or regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia with a pain outcome at six or 12 months after surgery.Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, including information on adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional information. Results are presented as pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI), based on random-effects models (inverse variance method). We grouped studies according to surgical interventions. We employed the Chi(2) test and calculated the I(2) statistic to investigate study heterogeneity.We identified 23 RCTs studying local anaesthetics or regional anaesthesia for the prevention of persistent (chronic) pain after surgery. Data from a total of 1090 patients with outcomes at six months and of 441 patients with outcomes at 12 months were presented. No study included children. We pooled data from 250 participants after thoracotomy, with outcomes at six months. Data favoured regional anaesthesia for the prevention of chronic pain at six months after thoracotomy with an OR of 0.33 (95\% CI 0.20 to 0.56). We pooled two studies on paravertebral block for breast cancer surgery; the pooled data of 89 participants with outcomes at five to six months favoured paravertebral block with an OR of 0.37 (95\% CI 0.14 to 0.94).The methodological quality of the included studies was intermediate. Adverse effects were not studied systematically and were reported sparsely. Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered the assessment of effects, especially at 12 months.Epidural anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing chronic pain after thoracotomy in about one patient out of every four patients treated. Paravertebral block may reduce the risk of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery in about one out of every five women treated. Our conclusions are significantly weakened by performance bias, shortcomings in allocation concealment, considerable attrition and incomplete outcome data. We caution that our evidence synthesis is based on only a few, small studies. More studies with high methodological quality, addressing various types of surgery and different age groups, including children, are needed.},

  Abstract                 = {This systematic review was performed to determine the incidence and the severity of chronic pain at 3 and 6 months after thoracotomy based on meta-analyses. We conducted MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar searches of databases and references for English articles; 858 articles were reviewed. Meta-regression analysis based on the publication year was used to examine if the chronic pain rates changed over time. Event rates and confidence intervals with random effect models and Freeman-Tukey double arcsine variance-stabilizing transformation were obtained separately for the incidence of chronic pain based on 1,439 patients from 17 studies at 3 months and 1,354 patients from 15 studies at 6 months. The incidences of chronic pain at 3 and 6 months after thoracotomy were 57\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 51-64\%) and 47\% (95\% CI, 39-56\%), respectively. The average severity of pain ratings on a 0 to 100 scale at these times were 30 ± 2 (95\% CI, 26-35) and 32 ± 7 (95\% CI, 17-46), respectively. Reported chronic pain rates have been largely stable at both 3 and 6 months from the 1990s to the present.This systematic review's findings suggest that reported chronic pain rates are approximately 50\% at 3 and 6 months and have been largely stable from the 1990s to the present. The severity of this pain is not consistently reported. Chronic pain after thoracotomy continues to be a significant problem despite advancing perioperative care.},

  Abstract                 = {Persistent postmastectomy pain (PPMP) is increasingly recognized as a major individual and public health problem. Although previous studies have investigated surgical, medical, and demographic risk factors, in this study we aimed to more clearly elucidate the relationship of psychosocial factors to PPMP. Postmastectomy patients (611) were queried about pain location, severity, and burden 38.3 plus minus 35.4 months postoperatively. Validated questionnaires for depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep, perceived stress, emotional stability, somatization, and catastrophizing were administered. Detailed surgical, medical, and treatment information was abstracted from patients' medical records. One third (32.5\%) of patients reported PPMP, defined as > 3/10 pain severity in the breast, axilla, side, or arm, which did not vary according to time since surgery. Multiple regression analysis revealed significant and independent associations between PPMP and psychosocial factors, including catastrophizing, somatization, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. Conversely, treatment-related factors including surgical type, axillary node dissection, surgical complication, recurrence, tumor size, radiation, and chemotherapy were not significantly associated with PPMP. These data confirm previous studies suggesting that PPMP is relatively common and provide new evidence of significant associations between psychosocial characteristics such as catastrophizing with PPMP, regardless of the surgical and medical treatment that patients receive, which may lead to novel strategies in PPMP prevention and treatment.This cross-sectional cohort study of 611 postmastectomy patients investigated severity, location, and frequency of pain a mean of 3.2 years after surgery. Significant associations between pain severity and individual psychosocial attributes such as catastrophizing were found, whereas demographic, surgical, medical, and treatment-related factors were not associated with persistent pain.},

  Abstract                 = {An incision of hairy skin of the rat's back provides a new model for postincisional pain to determine the importance of cutaneous anesthesia.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sevoflurane and given a 0.6-ml subcutaneous injection of bupivacaine (0.25\%) under the incision site or the medial lumbar dorsum or at the nuchal midline, 30 min before a 1.0-cm skin incision. Mechanical stimuli (von Frey hairs, 18-250 mN) were applied to measure nociception, indicated by twitching of local subcutaneous muscles, the cutaneus trunci muscle reflex. A graded response score, averaging the twitches weighted by their vigor, or a population response score, measuring the fraction of rats that showed any response, was assessed for 3 days before and over 7 days after incision. von Frey hairs were applied 0.5 cm from the incision to test primary hyperalgesia and 2.0 cm contralateral to the incision for secondary hyperalgesia.Incision induced responses to stimuli that had no effect on intact skin (allodynia) and also enhanced responses to forces that normally gave less than the full reflex (hyperalgesia). Hyperalgesia was present 30 min after surgery, peaked at 3-6 h, and persisted through the week; allodynia had a similar onset but was briefer. Both changes were transiently reversed by subcutaneous morphine (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal). Subcutaneous bupivacaine (0.25\%), injected preoperatively at the incision site and anesthetizing skin for 2-3 h, suppressed primary allodynia for 1 week but had no effect on hyperalgesia. Secondary allodynia was obliterated, and secondary hyperalgesia attenuated by this treatment. Bupivacaine injected subcutaneously at the nuchal midline before surgery was also effective in abbreviating primary and secondary allodynia, with no signs of sedation, ataxia, or preconvulsive behavior.Incision of rat hairy skin changes pain responses, similar to pain in humans. Preincisional subcutaneous bupivacaine selectively suppresses and shortens allodynia for times far outlasting its local anesthesia, an effect largely from systemic actions.},

  Abstract                 = {Acute postoperative pain is followed by persistent pain in 10-50\% of individuals after common operations, such as groin hernia repair, breast and thoracic surgery, leg amputation, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Since chronic pain can be severe in about 2-10\% of these patients, persistent postsurgical pain represents a major, largely unrecognised clinical problem. Iatrogenic neuropathic pain is probably the most important cause of long-term postsurgical pain. Consequently, surgical techniques that avoid nerve damage should be applied whenever possible. Also, the effect of aggressive, early therapy for postoperative pain should be investigated, since the intensity of acute postoperative pain correlates with the risk of developing a persistent pain state. Finally, the role of genetic factors should be studied, since only a proportion of patients with intraoperative nerve damage develop chronic pain. Based on information about the molecular mechanisms that affect changes to the peripheral and central nervous system in neuropathic pain, several opportunities exist for multimodal pharmacological intervention. Here, we outline strategies for identification of patients at risk and for prevention and possible treatment of this important entity of chronic pain.},

  Abstract                 = {Surgical injury can frequently lead to chronic pain. Despite the obvious importance of this problem, the first publications on chronic pain after surgery as a general topic appeared only a decade ago. This study tests the hypothesis that chronic postsurgical pain was, and still is, represented insufficiently.We analyzed the presentation of this topic in journal articles covered by PubMed and in surgical textbooks. The following signs of insufficient representation in journal articles were used: (1) the lack of journal editorials on chronic pain after surgery, (2) the lack of journal articles with titles clearly indicating that they are devoted to chronic postsurgical pain, and (3) the insufficient representation of chronic postsurgical pain in the top surgical journals.It was demonstrated that insufficient representation of this topic existed in 1981-2000, especially in surgical journals and textbooks. Interest in this topic began to increase, however, mostly regarding one specific surgery: herniorrhaphy. It is important that the change in the attitude toward chronic postsurgical pain spreads to other groups of surgeries.Chronic postsurgical pain is still a neglected topic, except for pain after herniorrhaphy. The change in the attitude toward chronic postsurgical pain is the important first step in the approach to this problem.},

  Abstract                 = {As a broader definition of preemptive analgesia, preventive analgesia aims to prevent the sensitization of central nervous system, hence the development of pathologic pain after tissular injury. To demonstrate benefits from preventive treatment, objective measurement of postoperative pain such as wound hyperalgesia and persistent pain should be evaluated. The current study assessed the role and timing of epidural analgesia in this context.In a randomized, double-blinded trial, 85 patients scheduled to undergo neoplastic colonic resection were included. All the patients received a thoracic epidural catheter, systemic ketamine at a antihyperalgesic dose, and general anesthesia. Continuous infusion of analgesics belonging to the same class was administered by either intravenous or epidural route before incision until 72 h after surgery. Patients were allocated to four groups to receive intraoperative intravenous lidocaine-sufentanil-clonidine or epidural bupivacaine-sufentanil-clonidine followed postoperatively by either intravenous (lidocaine-morphine-clonidine) or epidural (bupivacaine-sufentanil-clonidine) patient-controlled analgesia. Postoperative pain scores (visual analog scale), analgesic consumption, wound area of punctuate hyperalgesia, residual pain, and analgesics needed from 2 weeks until 12 months were recorded.Analgesic requirements, visual analog scale scores, and area of hyperalgesia were significantly higher in the intravenous treatment group (intravenous-intravenous), and more patients reported residual pain from 2 weeks until 1 yr (28\%). Although postoperative pain measurements did not differ, postoperative epidural treatment (intravenous-epidural) was less effective to prevent residual pain at 1 yr (11\%; P = 0.2 with intravenous-intravenous group) than intraoperative one (epidural-epidural and epidural-intravenous groups) (0\%; P = 0.01 with intravenous-intravenous group).Combined with an antihyperalgesic dose of ketamine, intraoperative epidural analgesia provides effective preventive analgesia after major digestive surgery.},

Most of the available data arise from studies with methodological problems (especially its definition in terms of duration, severity, and effect on quality of life and function); however, more recent investigations have begun to address these issues. Although the quoted incidence varies considerably, analysis of the most conservative data shows that there is no doubt that persistent postoperative pain is a significant clinical problem and a burden to those who suffer from it. There is a wealth of literature describing factors associated with increased likelihood of persistent postoperative pain. Although it is difficult to be precise, it is clear that psychosocial factors probably play a role in some situations and that significant preoperative pain, severe immediate postoperative pain, and nerve damage are often good predictors. There are some data indicating that the incidence and severity of persistent postoperative pain can be reduced by special perioperative interventions; however, as yet, the evidence is not compelling and consistent. A reliable prevention strategy is not yet emerging from the published literature and considerably more work is required to deliver this.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigated the incidence and risk factors associated with chronic pain after elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia in an Asian population. A prospective cohort study was conducted among subjects who underwent elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, with morphine patient-controlled analgesia administered for 24 hours postoperatively. Perioperative, surgical and obstetric factors were investigated prospectively. Phone surveys were conducted to identify risk factors associated with chronic pain. A total of 857 subjects completed both the perioperative study and phone survey. The incidence of wound scar pain for three months after surgery was 9.2\% (79). Of the 51 subjects with persistent pain at the time of subsequent survey, 9.8\% (n = 5) had constant pain, 9.8\% (n = 5) had daily pain and 23.5\% (n = 12) had pain intermittently, at an interval of days. The independent risk factors for development of chronic pain were higher pain scores recalled in the immediate postoperative period (odds ratio [OR, 95\% confidence interval] 1.348 [1.219 to 1.490], P = 0.0001), pain present elsewhere (OR 2.471 [1.485 to 4.112], P = 0.001) and non-private insurance status (OR 1.679 [1.034 to 2.727], P = 0.036). The two most common sites of pain other than wound pain were back pain (n = 316) and migraine (n = 87).},
